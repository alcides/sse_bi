4,63,"Benchmarking the Dependability of Different OLTP Systems","On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems constitute the kernel of the information systems used today to support the daily operations of most organizations. Although these systems comprise the best examples of complex business-critical systems, no practical way has been proposed so far to characterize the impact of faults in such systems or to compare alternative solutions concerning dependability features. This paper presents a practical example of benchmarking key dependability features of four different transactional systems using a first proposal of dependability benchmark for OLTP application environments. This dependability benchmark is an extension to the TPC-C standard performance benchmark, and specifies the measures and all the steps required to evaluate both the performance and dependability features of OLTP systems. Two different versions of the Oracle transactional engine running over two different operating systems were evaluated and compared. The results show that dependability benchmarking can be successfully applied to OLTP application environments.","Dependability benchmarking","Dependability benchmarking, transactional systems, experimental dependability evaluation",2003-06-22,2003,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4
5,63,"Definition of Software Fault Emulation Operators: a Field Data Study","This paper proposes a set of operators for software fault emulation through low-level code mutations. The definition of these operators was based on the analysis of an extensive collection of real software faults. Using the Orthogonal Defect Classification as a starting point, faults were classified in a detailed manner according to the high-level constructs where the faults reside and their effects in the program. We observed that a large percentage of faults fall in well-defined classes and can be characterized in a very precise way, allowing accurate emulation through a small set of mutation operators. The resulting operators closely emulate a broad range of common programmer mistakes. Furthermore, as the mutation is performed directly at the executable code, software faults can be injected in targets for which source is not available.","Software Fault Emulation","Fault Injection, Software Fault Emulation, Fault characterisation",2003-06-22,2003,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4
6,63,"Characterization of Operating Systems Behavior in the presence of Faulty Drivers through Software Fault Emulation","This paper proposes a practical way to evaluate the behavior of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) operating systems in the presence of faulty device drivers. The proposed method is based on the emulation of software faults in target device drivers and the observation of the behavior of the system and of a workload regarding a comprehensive set of failure modes analyzed according to different dimensions. The emulation of software faults itself is done through the injection at machine-code level of selected mutations that represent the code produced when typical programming errors are made in the high-level language code. An important aspect of the proposed methodology is the use of simple and established practices to evaluate operating systems failure modes, thus allowing its use as a dependability benchmarking technique. The generalization of the methodology to any software system built of discrete and identifiable components is also discussed.","Software Fault Emulation and Injection","Fault Injection, Software Fault, Emulation, Dependability Evaluation",2002-12-16,2002,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4
7,63,"Emulation of Software Faults by Selective Mutations at Machine-Code Level","This paper proposes a new technique to emulate software faults by educated mutations introduced at the machine-code level and presents an experimental study on the accuracy of the injected faults. The proposed method consists of finding key programming structures at the machine code-level where high-level software faults can be emulated. The main advantage of emulating software faults at the machine-code level is that software faults can be injected even when the source code of the target application is not available, which is very important for the evaluation of COTS components or for the validation of software fault tolerance techniques in COTS based systems. The technique was evaluated using several real programs and different types of faults and, additionally, it includes our study on the key aspects that may impact on the technique accuracy. The portability of the technique is also addressed. The results show that classes of faults such as assignment, checking, interface, and simple algorithm faults can be directly emulated using this technique.","Software Fault Emulation","Software fault emulation, fault representativeness",2002-11-12,2002,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4
9,63,"The OLAP and Data Warehousing Approaches for Analysis and Sharing of Results from Dependability Evaluation Experiments","Two important questions on experimental dependa-bility evaluation remain largely unanswered: 1) how to analyze the usually large amount of raw data produced in dependability evaluation experiments and 2) how to compare results from different experiments or results from similar experiments across different systems. These problems are also common to other dependability evaluation techniques such as the ones based on simulation, or even to the analysis of field data on computer faults. We propose the use of data warehousing technologies to store raw results from different experiments/setups in a common multidimensional structure where raw data can be analyzed and shared world wide by means of web-enabled OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) tools. This paper describes how to use the proposed approach in a concrete example of dependability evaluation experiment.","Dependability Evaluation Analysis","Dependability Evaluation Analysis",2003-06-22,2003,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

11,63,"Definition of Faultloads Based on Operator Faults for DMBS Recovery Benchmarking","The characterization of Database Management Sys-tems (DBMS) recovery mechanisms and the comparison of the recovery features of different DBMS require a practical approach to benchmark the effectiveness of recovery in the presence of faults.  Existing performance benchmarks for transactional and database areas include two major components: a workload and a set of performance measures. The definition of a benchmark to characterize DBMS recovery needs a new component ' the faultload. A major cause of failures in large DBMS is operator faults, which make them an excellent starting point for the definition of a generic faultload. This paper proposes the steps for the definition of generic faultloads based on operator faults for DBMS recovery benchmarking. A classification for operator faults in DBMS is proposed and a comparative analysis among three commercially DBMS is presented. The paper ends with a practical example of the use of operator faults to benchmark different configurations of the recovery mechanisms of the Oracle 8i DBMS.","Operator Faults","Operator Faults, Faultload,",2002-12-17,2002,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4
12,63,"Recovery and Performance Balance of a COTS DBMS in the Presence of Operator Faults","A major cause of failures in large database manage-ment systems (DBMS) is operator faults. Although most of the complex DBMS have comprehensive recovery mecha¬nisms, the effectiveness of these mechanisms is difficult to characterize. On the other hand, the tuning of a large database is very complex and database administrators tend to concentrate on performance tuning and disregard the recovery mechanisms. Above all, database adminis¬trators seldom have feedback on how good a given con¬figuration is concerning recovery. This paper proposes an experimental approach to characterize both the perfor-mance and the recoverability in DBMS. Our approach is presented through a concrete example of benchmarking the performance and recovery of an Oracle DBMS run¬ning the standard TPC-C benchmark, extended to include two new elements: a faultload based on operator faults and measures related to recoverability. A classification of operator faults in DBMS is proposed.

16,63,"Approximate Query Answering Using Data Warehouse Striping","This paper presents and evaluates a simple but very effective method to implement large data ware-houses on an arbitrary number of computers, achieving very high query execution performance and scalability. The data is distributed and processed in a potentially large number of autonomous computers using our technique called data warehouse striping (DWS). The major problem of DWS technique is that it would require a very expen-sive cluster of computers with fault tolerant capabilities to prevent a fault in a single computer to stop the whole system. In this paper, we propose a radically different approach to deal with the problem of the unavailability of one or more computers in the cluster, allowing the use of DWS with a very large number of inexpensive computers. The proposed approach is based on approximate query answering techniques that make it possible to deliver an approximate answer to the user even when one or more computers in the cluster are not available. The evaluation presented in the paper shows both analytically and experimentally that the approximate results obtained this way have a very small error that can be negligible in most of the cases.","Data Warehousing","Data warehousing, distributed query optimization, data partitioning, performance optimization,",2002-09-01,2002,3,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

18,63,"Adding a performance-oriented perspective to data warehouse design","Data warehouse design is clearly dominated by the business perspective. Quite often, data warehouse administrators are lead to data models with little room for performance improvement. However, the increasing demands for interactive response time from the users make query performance one of the central problems of data warehousing today. In this paper we defend that data warehouse design must take into account both the business and the performance perspective from the beginning, and we propose the extension to typical design methodologies to include performance concerns in the early design steps. Specific analysis to predicted data warehouse usage profile and meta-data analysis are proposed as new inputs for improving the transition from logical to physical schema. The proposed approach is illustrated and discussed using the TPC-H performance benchmark and it is shown that significant performance improvement can be achieved without jeopardizing the business view required for data warehouse models.","Data Warehousing",,2002-09-02,2002,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4
19,63,"A new index for data warehouses","There are several auxiliary pre-computed access structures that allow faster answers by reading less base data. Examples are materialized views, join indexes, B-tree and bitmap indexes. This paper proposes dimension-join, a new type of index especially suited for data warehouses. The dimension-join borrows ideas from several concepts. It is both a bitmap index and a multi-table join and when being used one of the tables is not read to improve performance. It is a multi-table join because it holds information belonging to two tables, which is similar to the join index proposed by Valduriez. However, instead of being composed by the tables primary keys, the dimension-join index is also a bitmap index over the fact table using values from a dimension column. The dimension-join index is very useful when selecting facts depending of dimension tables belonging to snowflakes. The dimension-join represents a direct connection between the fact table and a table in the snowflake that can avoid several joins and produce enormous performance improvements. This paper also evaluates experimentally the dimension-join indexes using the TPC-H benchmark and shows that this new index structure can dramatically improve the performance for some queries.","Data Warehousing",,2001-10-01,2001,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

ESFFI (Emulation of Software Faults by Fault Injection) leverages matured fault injection techniques, which have been used so far for the emulation of hardware faults, and adds new features that make possible the insertion of errors mimicking those caused by real software faults. The major advantage of ESFFI over other techniques that also emulate software faults (mutations, for instance) is making fault locations ubiquitous; every software module can be targeted no matter if it is a device driver running in operating kernel mode or a 3rd party component whose source code is not available.

27,63,"On the Emulation of Software Faults by Software Fault Injection","This paper presents an experimental study on the emulation of software faults by fault injection. In a first experiment, a set of real software faults has been compared with faults injected by a SWIFI tool (Xception) to evaluate the accuracy of the injected faults. Results revealed the limitations of Xception (and other SWIFI tools) in the emulation of different classes of software faults (about 44% of the software faults cannot be emulated). The use of field data about real faults was discussed and software metrics were suggested as an alternative to guide the injection process when field data is not available. In a second experiment, a set of rules for the injection of errors meant to emulate classes of software faults was evaluated. The fault triggers used seem to be the cause for the observed strong impact of the faults in the target system and in the program results. The results also show the influence in the fault emulation of aspects such as code size, complexity of data structures, and recursive versus sequential execution.","Software Fault Emulation",,2000-06-25,2000,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

36,63,"State of the Art","The DBench (Dependability Benchmarking) project aims at formulating a conceptual framework for benchmarking the dependability of COTS and COTS-based systems. As a starting point of the project, this report surveys and comments on the state-of-the-art techniques in selected areas that we have currently identified to be pertinent for the activity of conducting the benchmarking process.
The areas covered encompass defining the context of benchmarking and its conjunction with issues of dependability. These include aspects of dependability assessment (such as analytical modelling, fault injection and field measurement), performance benchmarking and robustness benchmarking. For each area, several techniques and problems relevant to dependability benchmarking are identified, including areas requiring more research. This report compiles our current opinions on the topics and establishes the background for further DBench activities.
The survey identifies that representativeness is a key feature, since it is important both for fault injection experiments as well as for performance benchmarks. 
Another insight derived from the survey is the importance of considering dependability in association with functionality and performance attributes of the systems ' a stand-alone interpretation of dependability is probably not an objective property of any system. Furthermore, past experience has shown using a combined experimental and modelling approach to been successful in assessing computer system dependability. Accordingly, applying this to dependability benchmarking is also of interest, and warrants further research.
Finally, the problem of presenting relevant results to the users of a benchmark is an important facet. Performance benchmarks have typically employed a policy of presenting a few easy to understand metrics to the benchmark user. This has been a successful approach as benchmark users are not required to be experts on the subject. However, the basic issue here is ascertain the technical value of a benchmark with r","Dependability benchmarking",,2001-08-01,2001,8,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

The multiple dimensions of the problem are discussed and the framework is presented through a set of dependability benchmarking scenarios, ranging from pure experimental approaches to benchmarking scenarios where modelling and experimentation are tightly coupled.

Besides the problem of roundoff error in floating point arithmetic, we identify two further weakpoints, namely lack of protection of data during input and output, and incorrect execution of the correctness checks. We propose the Robust ABFT technique to handle those weakpoints. We then generalize it to programs that use assertions, where similar problems arise, leading to the technique of Robust Assertions, whose effectiveness is shown by fault injection experiments on a realistic control application. With this technique a system follows a new failure model, that we call Fail-Bounded, where with high probability all results produced are either correct or, if wrong, they are within a certain bound of the correct value, whose exact value depends on the output assertions used.

On the other hand, the tuning of a large database is very complex and database administrators tend to concentrate on performance tuning and disregard the recovery mechanisms.

360,63,"Plug and Play Fault Injector for Dependability Benchmarking","The increased reliance of our society on computers requires that their dependability be measured. Benchmarks with that objective must include fault injectors that are very simple to use. They should be downloadable from the web together with the other components of the benchmark, be able to target all system components, and should not require any complex setup or installation procedure. Since the existing injectors did not fulfill this requirement, we have developed DBench-FI, a fault injector for dependability benchmarking that is very simple to install and use. DBench-FI belongs to the software implemented fault injection (SWIFI) family, since no special hardware can be used for this purpose. The current version targets the Linux OS on Intel processors, and uses a flexible runtime kernel upgrading algorithm to allow access to the target process memory space, that can be in either user or system space, enabling in this way the injection of faults. Furthermore, it does not require the availability of the source code of any system component or user process. It is not based on any debug mode either, being able to inject faults even in tasks that were already running when it is installed, irrespective of their complexity, like the Oracle Database Management System that is used in the examples in the paper. This set of features is, to the best of our knowledge, unique. It currently only injects memory faults, but there are plans to include other fault models in the future. In order to demonstrate the capability of the DBench-FI tool, the results of complex fault injection campaigns are presented.","Software Fault Emulation","SWIFI, Dependability Benchmarking",2003-10-21,2003,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

The first part of the paper investigates the possibilities of accurate emulation of real software faults by a SWIFI tool (Xception). Results revealed the limitations of Xception (and other SWIFI tools) in the emulation of several classes of software faults. Based on this first conclusion, the paper presents G-SWFIT which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first technique specifically proposed for the injection of software faults. The feasibility and accuracy of G SWFIT have been experimentally evaluated, and the results show that this technique provides a very good accuracy. The technique is also quite portable, as all the details related to the emulation of software faults in different en-vironments are encapsulated in fault emulation operator libraries.","Software Fault Emulation and Injection","Software Fault Emulation, Ortogonal Defect Classification",2003-10-21,2003,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

validation and presents the architecture of a pin-level fault injector called RIFLE. This system can be adapted to a wide range of target systems and the faults are mainly injected in the processor pins. The injection of the faults is deterministic and can be reproduced if needed. Faults of different nature can be injected and the fault injector is able to detect whether the injected fault has produced an error or not without the requirement of feedback circuits. RIFLE can also detect specific circumstances in which the injected faults do not affect the target system. Sets of faults with specific impact on the target system can be generated. The paper also presents fault injection results showing the coverage and latency achieved with a set of simple behavior based error detection mechanisms. It is shown that up to 72,5% of the errors can be detected with fairly simple mechanisms. Furthermore, for over 90% of the faults the target system has behaved according to the fail-silent model, which suggests that a traditional computer equipped
with simple error detection mechanisms is relatively close to a fail-silent computer.","Fault Injection","Pin-level Fault Injection",1994-10-01,1994,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

This paper presents a proposal for the benchmarking of the dependability properties of web-servers. Our benchmark is composed of the three key components: measures, workload, and faultload. We use the SPECWeb99 benchmark as starting point, adopting the workload and performance measures from this performance benchmark, and we added the faultload and new measures related to dependability. We illustrate the use of the proposed benchmark through a case-study involving two widely used web servers (Apache and Abyss) running on top of three different operating systems. The faultloads used encompass software faults, hardware faults and network faults. We show that by using the proposed dependability benchmark it is possible to observe clear differences regarding dependability properties of the web-servers.","Dependability benchmarking",,2004-09-21,2004,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

776,63,"Generic Faultloads Based on Software Faults for Dependability Benchmarking","The most critical component of a dependability benchmark is the faultload, as it should represent a repeatable, portable, representative, and generally accepted set of faults. These properties are essential to achieve the desired standardization level required by a dependability benchmark but, unfortunately, are very hard to achieve. This is particularly true for software faults, which surely accounts for the fact that this important class of faults has never been used in known dependability benchmark proposals. This paper proposes a new methodology for the definition of faultloads based on software faults for dependability benchmarking. Our methodology builds on previous published results based on field data and uses a fault injection technique based on executable code mutation to emulate programming errors. Faultload properties such as repeatability, portability and scalability are also analyzed and validated through experimentation using a case study of dependability benchmarking of web servers. We concluded that software fault based faultloads generated using our methodology are appropriate and useful for dependability benchmarking. As our methodology is not tied to any specific software vendor or platform, it can be used to generate faultloads for the evaluation of any software product such as OLTP systems. Another important characteristic of the proposed methodology is the independence of source code availability. This allows us to generate faultloads appropriate for dependability evaluation of generic COTS software modules or systems.","Software Fault Emulation and Injection",,2004-09-28,2004,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

This is not yet the case, as there are still significant uncertainties at several levels of the evaluation process. In this chapter we start by describing the available experimental techniques that help in that process, like fault injection, robustness testing and field measurement. The capabilities and limitations of each of these techniques is presented, and the main dimensions required for them to participate in systematic dependability benchmarking are discussed, like how to build representative evaluation setups, choosing workloads and faultloads that are representative, portable and repeatable, and choosing the right measures to obtain meaningful results. After this, still only characterization data on fault tolerance methods will be available; to obtain global dependability measures like availability and reliability a modelling phase is required, where adequate fault rates are considered. We discuss also the development phase of a system where each of the previous techniques is applied, and end by presenting our opinion on the most important research directions for experimental dependability benchmarking.","Dependability Evaluation and Analysis","experimental dependability evaluation, fault injection, dependability benchmarking, field measurement, fault emulation, operator faults, software faults, hardware faults, robustness testing",2005-11-01,2005,5,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

The replication of the dimension tables creates a limitation to the applicability of the DWS technique to data warehouses with big dimensions. This paper proposes a strategy to handle large dimensions in a distributed DWS system and evaluates the proposed strategy experimentally. With the proposed strategy the performance speed up and scale up obtained in the DWS technique are not affected by the presence of big dimensions.

In fact, dimensions usually have a high number of text attributes and a reduction in the size of middle or large dimension have a big impact in the execution time of queries that join that dimension with the fact tables. In general, the high complexity and long execution time of most data warehouse queries make the compression of dimension text attributes (and possible text attributes that may exist in the fact table, such as false facts) an effective approach to speed up query response time.

Fault injection has been widely used for this purpose, however with the rapid increase in processor complexity, traditional techniques are also increasingly more difficult to apply. This paper presents a new software implemented fault injection and monitoring environment, called Xception, which is targeted for the modern and complex processors. Xception uses the advanced debugging and performance monitoring features existing in most of the modern processors to inject quite realistic faults by software, and to monitor the activation of the faults and their impact on the target system behavior in detail. Faults are injected with minimum interference with the target application. The target application is not modified, no software traps are inserted, and it is not necessary to execute the target application in special trace mode (the application is executed at full speed). Xception provides a comprehensive set of fault triggers, including spatial and temporal fault triggers, and triggers related to the manipulation of data in memory. Faults injected by Xception can affect any process running on the target system (including the kernel), and it is possible to inject faults in applications for which the source code is not available. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and potential of Xception in the evaluation of the dependability properties of the complex computer systems available nowadays.","Fault Injection",,1998-02-01,1998,3,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

Of the techniques tested to reduce the percentage of undetected wrong results only ABFT proved to be effective.

In this paper we analyze how software faults can be injected (emulated) in source-code independent manner. We specifically address important emulation requirements such as fault representativeness and emulation accuracy. We start with the analysis of an extensive collection of real software faults. We observed that a large percentage of faults falls into well-defined classes and can be characterized in a very precise way, allowing accurate emulation of software faults through a small set of emulation operators. A new software fault injection technique (G-SWFIT) based on emulation operators derived from the field study is proposed. This technique consists of finding key programming structures at the machine code-level where high-level software faults can be emulated. The fault-emulation accuracy of this technique is shown. This work also includes a study on the key aspects that may impact the technique accuracy. The portability of the technique is also discussed and it is shown that a high degree of portability can be achieved.","Fault Injection","Fault Injection, Software Faults, Software Reliability",2006-11-01,2006,3,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

1411,63,"An Empirical Approach to Assess Software Off-The-Shelf Components Using Fault Injection","Rigorous verification and validation of space software systems has always been mandatory, as these systems once deployed cannot be maintained, in most cases. Additionally, due to the intrinsic criticality of this type of systems, the failure of a given component might mean the loss of the mission. Nowadays, one can observe that off-the-shelf (OTS) components (or commercial off-the-shelf - COTS) are being used in onboard space systems (e.g. operating systems, run time libraries, etc.) in order to reduce project costs. The use of OTS components in real time safety critical applications may increase the failure probability, since these components are not designed and developed for environment with strict timing and/or safety requirements. The assessment approach proposed in this paper is based on the joint use of robustness testing (interface fault injection) and a particular fault injection technique named G-SWFIT that injects realistic software faults. The proposed toolset is meant both for 1) revealing OTS components vulnerabilities, which is suitable to be used early in the system life cycle, and 2) assess the impact of component failures in the entire system, within the 1st steps of validation. An example of using the proposed approach in a satellite data handling software prototype is also presented.","Verification and validation",,2006-05-22,2006,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

Although the interface faults injected by this approach can be considered as a possible consequence of actual software faults in real applications, the question of whether the typical exceptional inputs and invalid parameters used in these techniques do represent the consequences of software bugs is largely an open issue. This question may not be an issue in the context of robustness testing aimed at the identification of weaknesses in software components. However, the use of interface faults by API parameter corruption as a general approach for dependability evaluation in component-based systems requires an in depth study of interface faults and a close observation of the way internal component faults propagate to the component interfaces. In this work we present the results of experimental evaluation of realistic component-based applications developed in Java and C using the injection of interface faults by API parameter corruption and the injection of software faults inside the components by modification of the target code. The faults injected inside software components emulate typical programming errors and are based on an extensive field data study previously published. The results show the consequences of internal component faults in several operational scenarios and provide empirical evidences that interface faults and software component faults cause different impact in the system.","Fault Injection",,2006-10-16,2006,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

Obviously, the same confidence and quality of the custom made software components is expected from the commercial applications. In most cases, such products (COTS) are not designed with stringent timing and/or safety requirements as priorities. Thus, to decrease the gap between the use of custom made components and COTS components, this paper presents a methodology for evaluating COTS products in the scope of dependable, real time systems, through the application of fault injection techniques at key points of the software engineering process. By combining the use of robustness testing (fault injection at interface level) with software fault injection (using educated fault injection operators), a COTS component can be assessed in the context of the system it will belong to, with special emphasis given to timing and safety constraints that are usually imposed by the target real time dependable environment. In the course of this work, three case studies have been performed to assess the methodology using realistic scenarios that used common COTS products.","Verification and validation",,2007-02-26,2007,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

These systems, whose correct behavior is of extreme importance, use a database management system &#40;DBMS&#41; that assures transactional properties and provides data recovery features. Although these systems represent the best examples of business-critical systems, no practical way has been pro-posed so far to characterize and compare alternative solutions concerning dependability features. In fact, transac-tional systems industry holds a well established infrastructure for performance evaluation, where the benchmarks developed by the Transactional Performance Processing Council (TPC) represent the most important bench-marking initiative of all computer industry. However, as performance evaluation has been the main focus, de-pendability benchmarking of transactional systems has been largely disregarded over the years. This chapter proposes a dependability benchmark for OLTP application environments that specifies the measures and all components required to evaluate both the performance and key dependability features of OLTP systems, with particular emphasis on availability. The benchmark is presented through a concrete example of benchmarking the performance and dependability of several different transactional systems configurations.

This question is particularly relevant in scenarios where it is necessary to choose the most reliable COTS when several alternative components of equivalent functionality are available. The estimated risk introduced in the system by each component can help the system integrator in such cases. This paper proposes a practical approach to assess the risk of using a given software component (COTS or non COTS). Although we focus on comparing components, the methodology can be useful to assess the risk in individual modules. The proposed approach uses the injection of realistic residual software faults to assess the impact of possible component failures and uses software complexity metrics to estimate the probability of residual defects in software components. The proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated in a comparison scenario using two real and competing off-the-shelf components (the RTEMS and the RTLinux real time operating system) in a realistic application of a satellite data handling application used by the European Space Agency.","Fault Injection",,2007-06-25,2007,1,U,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

However, the use of a large number of inexpensive nodes increases the risk of having node failures that impair the computation of queries. This paper proposes an approach that provides Data Warehouse Striping with the capability of answering to queries even in the presence of node failures.

Although there are tools that allow testing Web applications against security vulnerabilities, previous research shows that the effectiveness of those tools in Web services environments is very poor. In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.

In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of security vulnerabilities in 300 publicly available Web services. Four well known vulnerability scanners have been used to identify security flaws in Web services implementations. A large number of vulnerabilities has been observed, which confirms that many services are deployed without proper security testing. Additionally, the differences in the vulnerabilities detected and the high number of false-positives (35% and 40% in two cases) and low coverage (less than 20% for two of the scanners) observed highlight the limitations of Web vulnerability scanners on detecting security vulnerabilities in Web services.

Indeed, the temporal dimension plays a key role on most of these systems, promoting better performance. Our goal is the definition of a temporal document representation, incorporating the time dimension into information retrieval model to improve the quality of the results. Our approach is based on temporal segmentation of documents. Temporal-aware retrieval models may explore a richer temporal document representation, enabled by segmentation. To achieve this, first we must identify temporal expressions and capture, when possible, their normalized time values. Starting from our prior work on temporal expressions recognition, we present in this paper, a resolution tool that achieves promising results in a Portuguese collection. Furthermore, a temporal characterization of the used collection shows enough and suitable information for a meaningful temporal document segmentation.","Temporal Information Extraction","Temporal Retrieval, Normalization, Temporal Expressions",0000-00-00,2010,1,Y,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

No entanto, a utilização de informação temporal para melhorar os resultados das pesquisas tem sido pouco explorada, apesar de existir um grande potencial para conseguir
esse melhoramento. De facto, a noção de tempo é essencial para muitas das pesquisas efectuadas num sistema de recolha de informação, como por exemplo, na área da saúde onde será pertinente reconstruir o historial clínico dos pacientes com a capacidade de encontrar eventos e apresentá-los num espaço temporal, permitindo, desta forma, dar maior exactidão ao relatório (Alonso et al., 2007). 
No entanto, nem sempre o tempo surge de forma explícita nos documentos, mas as referências temporais podem ajudar a identificar a relevância dos documentos encontrados. O interesse no processamento de informação temporal tem crescido nos últimos anos e tem-se intensificado nas mais diversas áreas de investigação.
O objectivo do sistema que desenvolvemos é o de identificar informação temporal existente em documentos, para posteriormente ser utilizada, como papel importante na ordenação da lista de resultados obtida pelas pesquisas efectuadas em sistemas de recolha de informação.
Como existe ainda pouco trabalho desenvolvido no processamento de informação temporal da língua portuguesa, decidimos criar um sistema de raiz que seguisse um algoritmo simples e rápido. O processo de anotação/extracção de informação num sistema de recolha de informação terá de ser rápido para que não comprometa todo o sistema.

The ad-vantages of using previously developed software in new projects are easily understood. However, reusing artifacts is usually done in an ad-hoc and incipient way, requiring an im-portant effort of adaptation, so developers frequently prefer to develop components from scratch. In this paper we present a strategy that is being adopted by Critical Software, a medium-sized company, to promote software reuse. This strategy starts by assuming that the success of software reuse is dependent on the ability of measuring its advantages. We have thus proposed the use of the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) technique, extend-ed with Data Warehousing data model design concepts to ex-tract a set of reuse-specific metrics for measuring the gains of reuse. We show that it is very easy to measure the productivity improvement due to code reuse, by simply measuring or esti-mating the efforts of developing a component for reuse, inte-grating it a new artifact, and developing this artifact, built with reusing the component.","Software Reuse","software reuse, metrics, GQM, Data Warehousing",2011-06-21,2011,1,N,"Henrique Madeira",henrique@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/63_Henrique1.jpg,1960-07-22,henrique,4

Robustness is defined as the degree to which a system operates correctly in the presence of exceptional inputs or stressful environmental conditions. As triggering robustness faults could in the worst case scenario even crash the system, detecting this type of faults is of utmost importance. This chapter presents the state of the art on robustness testing by summarizing the evolution of basic robustness testing techniques, giving an overview of the specific methods and tools developed for major application domains, and introducing penetration testing, a specialization of robustness testing, which searches for security vulnerabilities. Finally, the use of testing results in resilience modelling and analysis is discussed.

Virtualization is a cheap sand boxing solution that may be used to run multiple copies of a system, over which fault injection can be safely applied. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that the data generated in the virtualized environment can be used for training the algorithms that will run in the original system.

In many application areas, especially in mission-critical applications, certification is essential or even mandatory. However, the certification of software products using common off-the-shelf (COTS) components is difficult to attain, as detailed information about COTS is seldom available. Nevertheless, software products are increasingly being based on COTS components, which mean that traditional certification processes should be enhanced to take COTS into account in an effective way. This paper proposes a mean to help in the certification of component-based systems through an experimental risk assessment methodology based on fault injection and statistical analysis. Using the proposed methodology the certification authority or the system integrator can compare among components available the one that best fit for the system that is assembling a component that provides a specific functionality. Based on the results it is also possible to decide whether a software product may be considered certified or not in what concerns the risk of using a COTS into the system.

The data is distributed and processed in a potentially large number of autonomous computers using our technique called data warehouse striping (DWS). The major problem of DWS technique is that it would require a very expen-sive cluster of computers with fault tolerant capabilities to prevent a fault in a single computer to stop the whole system. In this paper, we propose a radically different approach to deal with the problem of the unavailability of one or more computers in the cluster, allowing the use of DWS with a very large number of inexpensive computers. The proposed approach is based on approximate query answering techniques that make it possible to deliver an approximate answer to the user even when one or more computers in the cluster are not available. The evaluation presented in the paper shows both analytically and experimentally that the approximate results obtained this way have a very small error that can be negligible in most of the cases.","Data Warehousing","Data warehousing, distributed query optimization, data partitioning, performance optimization,",2002-09-01,2002,3,U,"Pedro Furtado",pnf@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/64_,1975-01-01,pnf,4

The fact that they store enormous quantities of data is a challenge in what concerns performance and scalability, as users request instant answers. None of the traditional performance strategies is sufficiently good to make complex aggregation queries take only minutes or seconds. The summary warehouse (SW)  achieves such a speedup by storing only general-purpose sampling summaries well-fit for aggregated exploration analysis.  

The major limitation of SWs results from the tradeoff between accuracy and speed: smaller, faster summaries cannot answer less-aggregated queries. 

In this paper we present the Bag-of-Summaries approach (BofS) designed to deal effectively with this problem: BofS maintains a set of summaries with varied sizes and chooses the right one to answer a query with the desired accuracy and best possible speedup, based on query granularity considerations.

The fact that they store enormous quantities is a challenge in what concerns performance and scalability, as Gigabytes or Terabytes of data are stuffed in those systems, while users request instant answers to their queries. It is possible to return very fast approximate answers to user queries in exploration phases using pre-computed summaries. For instance, a query that would take two hours can be completed in one minute or less using a summary. Sampling has been proposed as a strategy to produce general-purpose summaries well-fit for all types of exploration analysis. However, their usage is constrained by the fact that there must be a representative number of samples in grouping intervals to yield acceptable accuracy. In this paper we propose and evaluate a technique that deals with the representation issue by using time interval-biased stratified samples (TISS). The technique is able to deliver fast accurate analysis to the user by taking advantage of the importance of the time dimension in most user analysis. It is designed as a transparent middle layer, which analyzes and rewrites the query to use a summary instead of the base data warehouse. The technique is presented and evaluated experimentally in a typical TPC-H setup. The estimations and error bounds returned using the technique are compared to those of traditional sampling summaries, to show that it achieves significant improvement in accuracy.","Data Warehousing","Approximate Summaries, OLAP",2002-09-03,2002,1,U,"Pedro Furtado",pnf@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/64_,1975-01-01,pnf,4
31,64,"Time-Stratified Sampling for Approximate Answers to Aggregate Queries","In large data warehousing environments, it is often advantageous to provide fast, approximate answers to complex aggregate queries based on samples of the full data. However, uniformly extracted samples often do not guarantee a number of samples in grouping interval estimations to yield acceptable accuracy. This is crucial in most practical less-aggregated analyses, which are mostly based on recent data (e.g. forecasting, performance analysis). 

We propose the use of time-interval stratified samples (TISS), a simple time-biased sampling strategy that produces summaries biased towards recency. This bias minimizes the representational issue and improves the accuracy in important less-aggregated analysis without significantly deteriorating aggregated analysis on older data. 

TISS obtains a much better accuracy than either uniform or the recently proposed congressional samples (CS) for queries analyzing recent data, while maintaining full ad-hoc usability. Furthermore, we show that TISS can be coupled with CS to combine very accurate TISS-like estimations with CS minimal representation guarantees on defined query patterns (TISS-CS). The use of CS in this context is important to provide an additional minimal representation guarantee on the less-well represented older data.","Data Warehousing","Approximate Summaries, OLAP",2003-03-24,2003,1,U,"Pedro Furtado",pnf@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/64_,1975-01-01,pnf,4

43,64,"DSQoS - Distributed architecture providing QoS in Summary Warehouses","Data warehouses (DW) that store enormous quantities of data put a major challenge in what concerns performance and scalability, as users request instant answers to their queries. Traditional solutions rely on very expensive architectures and structures for speedup and scale-up. The Summary warehouse (SW) is an inexpensive solution that has the potential to deliver very fast approximate answers to aggregate queries using only general-purpose sampling summaries.  
Although summaries are expected to be extremely fast, some analysis requires larger summaries to estimate individual group results, compromising the speedup advantage. This is the accuracy/speedup (A/S) tradeoff. 
In this paper we propose the 'Distributed Set-of-Summaries for Quality of Serviceâ? (DSQoS) that solves the A/S issue by optimizing the accuracy and response time for each query pattern in order to guarantee a desired Quality of Service (QoS). This QoS is defined in terms of response time and accuracy bounds. The strategy determines the required summary size to guarantee the accuracy targets and then dynamically select a set of summaries, distributed in various nodes, which can ensure the QoS constraints (time and accuracy). The strategy presents enormous possibilities since each node can contain summaries with different sizes, depending on the node characteristics, and can dynamically be added and removed from the system.
We discuss the design of the approach and the strategies used to process queries. In the experimental section we show how the approach is able to deliver almost instant and accurate answers without employing expensive architectures, which would be impossible using other strategies.","Data Warehousing","Approximate Query Answering, DataWarehouse, Sampling, OLAP",2003-11-06,2003,1,U,"Pedro Furtado",pnf@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/64_,1975-01-01,pnf,4

In this work, we present an external control system for QoS-oriented scheduling of database requests. Our external system prioritizes queries and automatically adjusts the number of queries that are concurrently executed (degree of multi-programming) in order to achieve user-specified Service Level Objectives (SLO). There are works on external schedulers, admission control systems and on the specification of the degree of multi-programming, but most focus on best-effort models and do not consider Service Level Objectives. Our experimental results show that our approach is effective and that using a specialized scheduler for achieving SLO is very important.

Sites are autonomous concerning candidacy for answering queries, in which case they must report an expected response time commitment to those queries. A reputation system is used for ranking sites on their response time estimations. Commitment information and subsequent outcome allows the reputation-based election-inspired approach to improve the overall mean response time of the system.

2707,64,"Quality of experience in distributed databases","This paper proposes an approach to improve the level of Quality of Experience (QoE) that distributed database systems provide. 

Quality of Experience is a measure of users' satisfaction when using a certain service or application. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to provide mechanisms to increase users' satisfaction when accessing distributed database systems.

In traditional database systems, users cannot specify execution-related constraints. Then, the database system cannot evaluate if user expectations are satisfied and neither the system can take corrective actions when necessary.  

In this work, we present the QoE-oriented distributed database system &#40;QoE-DDB&#41;. It allow users to specify Data Access Requirements (DARs) and aims to please users by satisfying the DARs they define. We define a set of types of Data Access Requirements and propose some SQL extensions that enable users to specify execution-related requirements. Proposed types of DARs include execution deadline and priority, execution start and finish times, data availability and freshness degrees, and disconnected execution mode. 

In our QoE-DDB, each user's command is transformed into one or more tasks that are executed by data services. Community modules and local data services negotiate Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for each task, which improves the system's dependability. We propose both QoE-oriented scheduling and dynamic data placement strategies. Proposed architecture and scheduling strategies enable the system to be used in a wide range of distributed environments, from tightly-coupled homogeneous environments (e.g. composed by off-the-shelf computers connected by a LAN) to highly heterogeneous and geographically distributed systems, where data services have some degree of autonomy. 

Traditional performance indicators (e.g. throughput and response time) are not adequate to measure the QoE a system provides. We also propose some specialized Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to estimate the QoE level a database system provides. 

Finally, we present experimental results obtained through the use benchmark data and queries together with a prototype that implements proposed strategies. In our experiments, we consider realistic scenarios and compare proposed scheduling strategies with their best-effort oriented counterparts. Obtained results prove the importance of our QoE-oriented approach.","QoE in distributed database systems","Distributed database, Quality of experience, Query scheduling, Data placement, Service level objectives, Data access requirements, Performance Indicators",0000-00-00,2011,3,Y,"Pedro Furtado",pnf@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/64_,1975-01-01,pnf,4

This advances the current state-of-the-art in middleware, by providing a single component that abstracts the underlying differences in both devices such as PCs and embedded devices and in communications such as tcp and proprietary stacks to create a global processor. We have successfully applied an embodiment of this concept as middleware component in our lab testbed within EU project. The evaluation shows that our middleware delivers as a truly useful hardware-abstracting configurable processor for application adaptation.

With this first-cut plan we test the performance of the network and if necessary reconfigure it. The results of tests given are followed by traffic-level adjustments of the system by several possible techniques: adjustment of number of nodes, network partitions, reduction of the sampling rate or in-network processing with strategies such as aggregation techniques or in-node closed control loops.

However, in industrial applications, WSNs still aren’t seen as a viable option because of the required fast sampling rates and the reduced time delay, particularly in a multi-hop deployment where traffic congestion may occur. Message losses are unacceptable, particularly in what concerns critical messages containing actuation instructions or other urgent data, which may have time-constraint requirements that cannot be guaranteed. Our research focuses on integrating traffic-aware data processing strategies and network traffic prioritization to overcome congestion states, in order to guarantee that urgent alarms and commands are enacted in time. Traffic is divided into urgent messages (alarms and actuation commands), that have time-delivery requirements; and the remaining periodic sensed data. In this paper we propose an integrated approach NetDP, which applies adaptable data processing strategies (DP) and traffic reduction (DP-Manager) policies to ensure that application requirements are satisfied with minimal message losses, while simultaneously guaranteeing timely delivery of alarms. We demonstrate that NETDP solution with different data processing strategies and levels of system stress can efficiently guarantee the timely delivery of alarms and actuation messages.","WSN, Planning","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Data Processing, Alarm delivery guarantees.",0000-00-00,2011,1,Y,"Pedro Furtado",pnf@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/64_,1975-01-01,pnf,4

Many new goal and data-oriented algorithms have been proposed for the problem of routing data in sensor networks. Most routing protocols can be classified as data-centric, hierarchical, location-based or QoS-aware. Data-centric protocols are query-based and depend on the naming of desired data. Hierarchical protocols aim at clustering the nodes so that cluster heads can do some aggregation and reduction of data in order to save energy. Location-based protocols utilize the position information to relay the data to the desired regions. The QoS-aware are based on general network-flow modeling for meeting some QoS requirements. In this chapter, we will explore the goal and data-oriented routing mechanisms for sensor networks developed in recent years.

Nowadays, storage capacity increased significantly at affordable prices (below 50$/terabyte) with improved transfer rates, and faster random access times particularly with modern SSD disks.

In order to accomplish that, they are adopting new storage schemas, developing better compression algorithms, using faster hardware, optimizing parallel and distributed data processing. Current row-wise systems do not exploit massive ordering redundancy, and current column-wise approaches exploit only partially. An important current research issue concerns replacing optimization and processing complexity by less complex but ultra fast solutions. We propose the varDB approach to optimize performance over data warehouses. The solution minimizes complex operators, by applying a simple scheme and organizing all structures and processing to that end: massive ordering with efficient sorting and log2N searching. Considering data warehouses, with periodic loads and frequent analysis operations, such an approach provides very fast query processing. In our work we show how it is possible to use this massive data ordering/sorting in order to optimize queries for high speed, even without the use of data compression (therefore also avoiding compression/decompression overheads). We dedicate our attention to sort columns of data and correlating them with other replicated and unsorted columns. For querying, we focus on binary-search and the use of mainly offsets. Our tests of loading data, sorting vs. creating indexes and executing very selective operations like data filtering and joining show, using a simple disk based prototype, that we are able to obtain much better performance comparing with optimized row-wise engines, and also improvements when comparing with column-wise optimized engines. Comparing to those we were able to attain at least similar performance for many queries and much better performance for queries with complex joins.

Throughput increases with the number of concurrent transactions until it reaches a saturation point (optimal EC) where more concurrent transactions lead to a drop in throughput. In order to sustain quality of service, it is essential to use admission control mechanisms that manage congestion and do not admit transactions that can't be executed within relevant quality-of service constraints, thus avoiding the degradation of performance for running transactions.

One important key of many such WSAN applications is the needed to meet non-functional requirements (e.g., lifetime, reliability, time guarantees) as well as functional ones (e.g. monitoring, actuation). Some application domains even require that sensor nodes be deployed in harsh environments (e.g., refineries), where they can fail due to communication interference, power problems or other issues. Unfortunately, the node failures can be catastrophic for critical or safety related systems. State machines can offer a promising approach to separate the two concerns – functional and non-functional – bringing forth reliability exception conditions handling, by means of fault handling states. We develop an approach that allows users to define and program typical applications using their platform language, but also adds state machine logic to design, view and handle explicitly other concerns such as reliability.

29,77,"The BofS Solution to Limitations of Approximate Summaries","Data warehouses are of crucial importance to decision-making in competitive organizations. The fact that they store enormous quantities of data is a challenge in what concerns performance and scalability, as users request instant answers. None of the traditional performance strategies is sufficiently good to make complex aggregation queries take only minutes or seconds. The summary warehouse (SW)  achieves such a speedup by storing only general-purpose sampling summaries well-fit for aggregated exploration analysis.  

The major limitation of SWs results from the tradeoff between accuracy and speed: smaller, faster summaries cannot answer less-aggregated queries. 

In this paper we present the Bag-of-Summaries approach (BofS) designed to deal effectively with this problem: BofS maintains a set of summaries with varied sizes and chooses the right one to answer a query with the desired accuracy and best possible speedup, based on query granularity considerations. We also present experimental results that show the advantage of BofS.","Data Warehousing","Approximate Summaries, OLAP",2003-03-24,2003,1,U,"João Pedro Costa",jpcosta@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/77_,1975-06-28,jpcosta,4
30,77,"Time-Interval Sampling for Improved Estimations in Data Warehouses","Data warehouses are of crucial strategic importance to decision-making in many competitive organizations. The fact that they store enormous quantities is a challenge in what concerns performance and scalability, as Gigabytes or Terabytes of data are stuffed in those systems, while users request instant answers to their queries. It is possible to return very fast approximate answers to user queries in exploration phases using pre-computed summaries. For instance, a query that would take two hours can be completed in one minute or less using a summary. Sampling has been proposed as a strategy to produce general-purpose summaries well-fit for all types of exploration analysis. However, their usage is constrained by the fact that there must be a representative number of samples in grouping intervals to yield acceptable accuracy. In this paper we propose and evaluate a technique that deals with the representation issue by using time interval-biased stratified samples (TISS). The technique is able to deliver fast accurate analysis to the user by taking advantage of the importance of the time dimension in most user analysis. It is designed as a transparent middle layer, which analyzes and rewrites the query to use a summary instead of the base data warehouse. The technique is presented and evaluated experimentally in a typical TPC-H setup. The estimations and error bounds returned using the technique are compared to those of traditional sampling summaries, to show that it achieves significant improvement in accuracy.","Data Warehousing","Approximate Summaries, OLAP",2002-09-03,2002,1,U,"João Pedro Costa",jpcosta@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/77_,1975-06-28,jpcosta,4
31,77,"Time-Stratified Sampling for Approximate Answers to Aggregate Queries","In large data warehousing environments, it is often advantageous to provide fast, approximate answers to complex aggregate queries based on samples of the full data. However, uniformly extracted samples often do not guarantee a number of samples in grouping interval estimations to yield acceptable accuracy. This is crucial in most practical less-aggregated analyses, which are mostly based on recent data (e.g. forecasting, performance analysis). 

We propose the use of time-interval stratified samples (TISS), a simple time-biased sampling strategy that produces summaries biased towards recency. This bias minimizes the representational issue and improves the accuracy in important less-aggregated analysis without significantly deteriorating aggregated analysis on older data. 

TISS obtains a much better accuracy than either uniform or the recently proposed congressional samples (CS) for queries analyzing recent data, while maintaining full ad-hoc usability. Furthermore, we show that TISS can be coupled with CS to combine very accurate TISS-like estimations with CS minimal representation guarantees on defined query patterns (TISS-CS). The use of CS in this context is important to provide an additional minimal representation guarantee on the less-well represented older data.","Data Warehousing","Approximate Summaries, OLAP",2003-03-24,2003,1,U,"João Pedro Costa",jpcosta@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/77_,1975-06-28,jpcosta,4

43,77,"DSQoS - Distributed architecture providing QoS in Summary Warehouses","Data warehouses (DW) that store enormous quantities of data put a major challenge in what concerns performance and scalability, as users request instant answers to their queries. Traditional solutions rely on very expensive architectures and structures for speedup and scale-up. The Summary warehouse (SW) is an inexpensive solution that has the potential to deliver very fast approximate answers to aggregate queries using only general-purpose sampling summaries.  
Although summaries are expected to be extremely fast, some analysis requires larger summaries to estimate individual group results, compromising the speedup advantage. This is the accuracy/speedup (A/S) tradeoff. 
In this paper we propose the 'Distributed Set-of-Summaries for Quality of Serviceâ? (DSQoS) that solves the A/S issue by optimizing the accuracy and response time for each query pattern in order to guarantee a desired Quality of Service (QoS). This QoS is defined in terms of response time and accuracy bounds. The strategy determines the required summary size to guarantee the accuracy targets and then dynamically select a set of summaries, distributed in various nodes, which can ensure the QoS constraints (time and accuracy). The strategy presents enormous possibilities since each node can contain summaries with different sizes, depending on the node characteristics, and can dynamically be added and removed from the system.
We discuss the design of the approach and the strategies used to process queries. In the experimental section we show how the approach is able to deliver almost instant and accurate answers without employing expensive architectures, which would be impossible using other strategies.","Data Warehousing","Approximate Query Answering, DataWarehouse, Sampling, OLAP",2003-11-06,2003,1,U,"João Pedro Costa",jpcosta@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/77_,1975-06-28,jpcosta,4

2783,77,"ONE: A Predictable and Scalable DW Model","The star schema model has been widely used as the facto DW storage organization on relational database management systems (RDBMS). The physical division in normalized fact tables (with metrics) and denormalized dimension tables allows a trade-off between performance and storage space while, at the same time offering a simple business understanding of the overall model as a set of metrics (facts) and attributes for business analysis (dimensions). However, the underlying premises of such trade-off between performance and storage have changed. Nowadays, storage capacity increased significantly at affordable prices (below 50$/terabyte) with improved transfer rates, and faster random access times particularly with modern SSD disks. In this paper we evaluate if the underlying premises of the star schema model storage organization still upholds. We propose an alternative storage organization (called ONE) that physically stores the whole star schema into a single relation, providing a predictable and scalable alternative to the star schema model. We use the TPC-H benchmark to evaluate ONE and the star schema model, assessing both the required storage size and query execution time.",DW,dw,2011-08-29,2011,1,Y,"João Pedro Costa",jpcosta@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/77_,1975-06-28,jpcosta,4

2785,77,"VarDB: High-Performance Warehouse Processing with Massive Ordering and Binary Search","Current data base management systems (DBMS) compete aggressively for performance. In order to accomplish that, they are adopting new storage schemas, developing better compression algorithms, using faster hardware, optimizing parallel and distributed data processing. Current row-wise systems do not exploit massive ordering redundancy, and current column-wise approaches exploit only partially. An important current research issue concerns replacing optimization and processing complexity by less complex but ultra fast solutions. We propose the varDB approach to optimize performance over data warehouses. The solution minimizes complex operators, by applying a simple scheme and organizing all structures and processing to that end: massive ordering with efficient sorting and log2N searching. Considering data warehouses, with periodic loads and frequent analysis operations, such an approach provides very fast query processing. In our work we show how it is possible to use this massive data ordering/sorting in order to optimize queries for high speed, even without the use of data compression (therefore also avoiding compression/decompression overheads). We dedicate our attention to sort columns of data and correlating them with other replicated and unsorted columns. For querying, we focus on binary-search and the use of mainly offsets. Our tests of loading data, sorting vs. creating indexes and executing very selective operations like data filtering and joining show, using a simple disk based prototype, that we are able to obtain much better performance comparing with optimized row-wise engines, and also improvements when comparing with column-wise optimized engines. Comparing to those we were able to attain at least similar performance for many queries and much better performance for queries with complex joins.

2786,77,"Towards a QoS-aware DBMS ","Quality of service is a key issue in current and future computer systems. Applications run on systems and typically access a backend DBMS which doesn't provide performance-related QoS guarantees, and whose resources are constrained. Throughput increases with the number of concurrent transactions until it reaches a saturation point (optimal EC) where more concurrent transactions lead to a drop in throughput. In order to sustain quality of service, it is essential to use admission control mechanisms that manage congestion and do not admit transactions that can't be executed within relevant quality-of service constraints, thus avoiding the degradation of performance for running transactions. In this paper we use a QoS Brokering architecture to enhance DBMS with QoS capabilities that allow the system to deliver QoS guarantees while sustaining large throughputs with reduced miss ratios.

3300,77,"A Modular Architecture for Reconfigurable Heterogeneous Networks with Embedded Devices","Wireless SAN (WSAN) may include wired and/or wireless devices, PCs and control stations arranged in a heterogeneous distributed system. Instead of assuming that embedded device nodes (e.g. MicaZ or TelosB motes), gateways (e.g. PC running Linux) and control stations are disparate entities with their own programming and processing model, it should be viewed as a single heterogeneous distributed system, offering more uniformity, simplicity and flexibility. Enabling adaptivity in the higher layers of the network architecture such as the middleware and application layers, beside its consideration in the lower layers, becomes of high importance. In this paper we propose an approach to hide heterogeneity and offer a single common configuration and processing component for all nodes of that heterogeneous system. In particular, this proposal aims at providing an abstraction to facilitate development of adaptive Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) applications. The main contribution of this paper is how to design a middleware architecture with a single uniform component to work with such heterogeneous underlying parts as a WSAN. This advances the current state-of-the-art in middleware for WSANs, by providing a single component that abstracts the underlying differences in both devices such as PCs and motes and in communications such as TCP and proprietary stacks to create a global processor.","Reconfigurable Heterogeneous Networks","Embedded Devices, SAN, Heterogeneous Network, Data Processing, (Re)Configuration",0000-00-00,2012,1,Y,"João Pedro Costa",jpcosta@dei.uc.pt,./images/photos/77_,1975-06-28,jpcosta,4

Existing performance benchmarks for transactional and database areas include two major components: a workload and a set of performance measures. The definition of a benchmark to characterize DBMS recovery needs a new component ' the faultload. A major cause of failures in large DBMS is operator faults, which make them an excellent starting point for the definition of a generic faultload. This paper proposes the steps for the definition of generic faultloads based on operator faults for DBMS recovery benchmarking. A classification for operator faults in DBMS is proposed and a comparative analysis among three commercially DBMS is presented.

Results revealed the limitations of Xception (and other SWIFI tools) in the emulation of different classes of software faults (about 44% of the software faults cannot be emulated). The use of field data about real faults was discussed and software metrics were suggested as an alternative to guide the injection process when field data is not available. In a second experiment, a set of rules for the injection of errors meant to emulate classes of software faults was evaluated. The fault triggers used seem to be the cause for the observed strong impact of the faults in the target system and in the program results.

360,78,"Plug and Play Fault Injector for Dependability Benchmarking","The increased reliance of our society on computers requires that their dependability be measured. Benchmarks with that objective must include fault injectors that are very simple to use. They should be downloadable from the web together with the other components of the benchmark, be able to target all system components, and should not require any complex setup or installation procedure. Since the existing injectors did not fulfill this requirement, we have developed DBench-FI, a fault injector for dependability benchmarking that is very simple to install and use. DBench-FI belongs to the software implemented fault injection (SWIFI) family, since no special hardware can be used for this purpose. The current version targets the Linux OS on Intel processors, and uses a flexible runtime kernel upgrading algorithm to allow access to the target process memory space, that can be in either user or system space, enabling in this way the injection of faults. Furthermore, it does not require the availability of the source code of any system component or user process. It is not based on any debug mode either, being able to inject faults even in tasks that were already running when it is installed, irrespective of their complexity, like the Oracle Database Management System that is used in the examples in the paper. This set of features is, to the best of our knowledge, unique. It currently only injects memory faults, but there are plans to include other fault models in the future. In order to demonstrate the capability of the DBench-FI tool, the results of complex fault injection campaigns are presented.","Software Fault Emulation","SWIFI, Dependability Benchmarking",2003-10-21,2003,1,U,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

Apesar da maior parte dos SGBD existentes possuírem mecanismos de recuperação bastante completos, a eficiência desses mecanismos é difícil de caracterizar. Por outro lado, a optimização de grandes SGBD é uma tarefa complexa e os administradores tendem em concentrar-se no desempenho, esquecendo muitas vezes os mecanismos de recuperação. A elevada complexidade destes mecanismos e o facto de raramente existir algum retorno sobre a eficiência de uma determinada configuração (em termos de recuperação), facilmente explicam este cenário.
Neste trabalho é proposta uma abordagem experimental para a avaliação do desempenho e da recuperação em SGBD. Esta abordagem baseia-se na extensão de benchmarks para avaliação do desempenho, através da introdução de dois novos elementos: 1) medidas relacionadas com a recuperação; e 2) uma faultload (conjunto de falhas ou condições que levem à activação dos mecanismos de recuperação) baseada em falhas de operador. 
Para além de constituir a primeira proposta de extensão de uma benchmark para avaliação do desempenho, de modo a permitir a caracterização da recuperação, este trabalho propõe ainda uma classificação e um método de emulação para falhas de operador em sistemas de bases de dados. Este método consiste na execução de comandos de administração errados, usando exactamente as mesmas ferramentas utilizadas pelos administradores de bases de dados no seu dia-a-dia (o que garante uma fiel reprodução deste tipo de falhas). As principais falhas de operador possíveis em três SGBD existentes no mercado, são identificadas e classificadas.
A abordagem experimental proposta é demonstrada através de um exemplo concreto de avaliação do desempenho e recuperação de diferentes configurações de um SGBD Oracle 8i, através da extensão da benchmark TPC-C. Esta abordagem experimental é genérica (i.e., pode ser aplicada em qualquer SGBD) e totalmente automática.

This paper presents a practical approach for the evaluation of the robustness of web-services infrastructures. A set of robustness tests (i.e., invalid web-services call parameters) is applied during web-services execution in order to reveal possible robustness problems in the web-services code and in the application server infrastructure. The approach is illustrated using two different implementations of the web-services specified by the TPC-App performance benchmark running on top of the JBoss application server. The proposed approach is generic and can be used to evaluate the robustness of web-services implementation (relevant for programmers) and application server infrastructures (relevant for administrators and system integrators).","Web services robustness",,2007-06-25,2007,1,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

We illustrate the use of the proposed benchmark through a case-study involving two widely used web servers running on top of three different operating systems. The faultloads used in our case-study encompass software faults, hardware faults and network faults.

These systems, whose correct behavior is of extreme importance, use a database management system &#40;DBMS&#41; that assures transactional properties and provides data recovery features. Although these systems represent the best examples of business-critical systems, no practical way has been pro-posed so far to characterize and compare alternative solutions concerning dependability features. In fact, transac-tional systems industry holds a well established infrastructure for performance evaluation, where the benchmarks developed by the Transactional Performance Processing Council (TPC) represent the most important bench-marking initiative of all computer industry. However, as performance evaluation has been the main focus, de-pendability benchmarking of transactional systems has been largely disregarded over the years. This chapter proposes a dependability benchmark for OLTP application environments that specifies the measures and all components required to evaluate both the performance and key dependability features of OLTP systems, with particular emphasis on availability. The benchmark is presented through a concrete example of benchmarking the performance and dependability of several different transactional systems configurations. The results obtained show clearly that it is possible to apply dependability benchmarking in transactional systems in a very successful way.","Dependability benchmarking",,2008-08-01,2008,5,N,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

In DWS the fact tables are distributed by an arbitrary number of low-cost computers and the queries are executed in parallel by all the com-puters, guarantying a nearly optimal speed up and scale up. However, the use of a large number of inexpensive nodes increases the risk of having node failures that impair the computation of queries. This paper proposes an approach that provides Data Warehouse Striping with the capability of answering to queries even in the presence of node failures.

Although there are tools that allow testing Web applications against security vulnerabilities, previous research shows that the effectiveness of those tools in Web services environments is very poor. In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.

Web vulnerability scanners allow detecting security vulnerabilities in Web services by stressing the service from the point of view of an attacker. However, research and practice show that different scanners have different performance on vulnerabilities detection. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of security vulnerabilities in 300 publicly available Web services. Four well known vulnerability scanners have been used to identify security flaws in Web services implementations. A large number of vulnerabilities has been observed, which confirms that many services are deployed without proper security testing. Additionally, the differences in the vulnerabilities detected and the high number of false-positives (35% and 40% in two cases) and low coverage (less than 20% for two of the scanners) observed highlight the limitations of Web vulnerability scanners on detecting security vulnerabilities in Web services.

2076,78,"An Appraisal to Assess the Security of Database Configurations","Database Management Systems (DBMS) have a long tradition in high security and several mechanisms needed to protect data have been proposed/consolidated in the database arena. However, the effectiveness of those mechanisms is very dependent on the actual configuration chosen by the database administrator. Tuning a large database is quite complex and achieving high security is a very difficult task that requires a lot of expertise and continuous and proactive work. In this paper we present an assessment tool aimed at evaluating the security of DBMS configurations. The proposed tool is simple and effective, and can be used by administrators with very little security knowledge. We evaluate the tool by performing the assessment of four different real database installations based on four well-known and widely used DBMS engines.","Computer security",,2009-06-18,2009,1,U,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

2096,78,"Comparing the Effectiveness of Penetration Testing and Static Code Analysis on the Detection of SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services","Web services are becoming business-critical components that must provide a non-vulnerable interface to the client applications. However, previous research and practice show that many web services are deployed with critical vulnerabilities. SQL injection vulnerabilities are particularly relevant, as Web services frequently access a relational database using SQL commands. Penetration testing and static code analysis are two well-know techniques often used for the detection of security vulnerabilities. In this work we compare how effective these two techniques are on the detection of SQL injection vulnerabilities in Web services code. To understand the strengths and limitations of these techniques, we used several commercial and open source tools to detect vulnerabilities in a set of vulnerable services. Results suggest that, in general, static code analyzers are able to detect more SQL injection vulnerabilities than penetration testing tools. Another key observation is that tools implementing the same detection approach frequently detect different vulnerabilities. Finally, many tools provide a low coverage and a high false positives rate, making them a bad option for programmers.

In a SOA environment providers supply a set of services that must be robust. Although SOA is being used in business-critical environments, there is no practical means to measure or compare the robustness of services. Robustness failures in such environments are dangerous, as they can be maliciously exploited with severe consequences for the attacked systems. This chapter addresses the problem of robustness validation in SOA environments. The approach proposed is based on a set of robustness tests that is used to discover both programming and design errors. Two concrete examples are presented: one focusing on web services and the other targeting Java Message Service (JMS) middleware. The proposed approach is useful for both providers (to validate the robustness of deployed services) and consumers (to select the services that best fit architectural requirements).","Web services robustness","Service Oriented Architectures, robustness testing",2009-10-27,2009,5,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

However, when executing robustness tests, a very large amount of service responses has to be manually classified to distinguish regular responses from responses that indicate robustness problems. Besides requiring a large amount of time and effort, this complex classification process can easily lead to errors resulting from the human intervention in such a laborious task. Text classification algorithms have been applied successfully in many contexts (e.g., spam identification, text categorization, etc) and are considered a powerful tool for the successful automation of several classification-based tasks. In this paper we present a study on the applicability of five widely used text classification algorithms in the context of web services robustness testing. In practice, we assess the effectiveness of Support Vector Ma-chines, Naïve Bayes, Large Linear Classification, K-nearest neighbor (Ibk), and Hyperpipes in classifying web services responses. Results indicate that these algorithms can be effec-tively used to automate the identification of robustness issues while reducing human intervention.

This paper proposes a learning-based approach to secure web services against SQL and XPath Injection attacks. Our approach is able to transparently learn valid request patterns (learning phase) and then detect and abort potentially harmful requests (protection phase). When it is not possible to have a complete learning phase, a set of heuristics can be used to accept/discard doubtful cases.

However, research shows that the effectiveness of most of those tools is very low and that using the wrong tool may lead to the deployment of services with undetected vulnerabilities. In this paper we propose a benchmarking approach to assess and compare the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools in web services environments. This approach was used to define a concrete benchmark for SQL Injection vulnerability detection tools. This benchmark is demonstrated by a real example of benchmarking several widely used tools, including four penetration-testers, three static code analyzers, and one anomaly detector. Results show that the benchmark accurately portrays the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools and suggest that the proposed approach can be applied in the field.

2567,78,"How to advance TPC benchmarks with dependability aspects","Transactional systems are the core of the information systems of most organizations. Although there is general acknowledgement that failures in these systems often entail significant impact both on the proceeds and reputation of companies, the benchmarks developed and managed by the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) still maintain their focus on reporting bare performance. Each TPC benchmark has to pass a list of dependability-related tests (to verify ACID properties), but not all benchmarks require measuring their performances. While TPC-E measures the recovery time of some system failures, TPC-H and TPC-C only require functional correctness of such recovery. Consequently, systems used in TPC benchmarks are tuned mostly for performance. In this paper we argue that nowadays systems should be tuned for a more comprehensive suite of dependability tests, and that a dependability metric should be part of TPC benchmark publications. The paper discusses WHY and HOW this can be achieved. Two approaches are introduced and discussed: augmenting each TPC benchmark in a customized way, by extending each specification individually; and pursuing a more unified approach, defining a generic specification that could be adjoined to any TPC benchmark.",,"Industry standard benchmarks, ACID properties, Durability, Dependability.",0000-00-00,2010,1,U,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

After testing a set of services, there is typically a very large quantity and variety of test results to be analyzed, which poses a challenge to the developer that has to manually process all results and identify the outputs that indicate the presence of bugs in the code. Previous research indicates that well-known automatic classification algorithms can be used to automate this step. However, the applicability of such algorithms is also limited, as they are frequently unable to deal with the large diversity of outputs present in typical WS scenarios, thus producing incorrect results. In this paper we propose an approach that allows the automatic classification of the results of WS robustness tests. The technique integrates rule-based classification (including domain rules) and conventional machine-learning algorithms trained using generic data. The proposed approach was used to classify a large set of results of tests performed over publicly available WS and also over in-house implementations of several TPC benchmarks. Results show the effectiveness of the technique, indicating that it can be integrated in the robustness testing procedure, enabling, in this way, the delivery of a full end-to-end automatic approach for WSs robustness testing.","Web services robustness classification","web services, robustness classification",2011-07-04,2011,1,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach we implemented a prototype tool to detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities in SOAP. An experimental evaluation comparing this prototype with three commercial penetration testers was conducted.

Recently, Test-Driven Development (TDD) emerged as software development technique based on test cases that are defined before development, as a way to validate functionalities. However, programmers typically disregard the verification of limit conditions, such as the ones targeted by robustness testing. Moreover, in TDD, tests are created before developing the functionality, conflicting with the typical robustness testing approach. This chapter discusses the integration of robustness testing in TDD for improving the robustness of web services during development. We have requested three programmers to create a set of services based on open-source code and to implement different versions of the services specified by TPC-App, using both TDD and the approach presented in this chapter.

This strategy starts by assuming that the success of software reuse is dependent on the ability of measuring its advantages. We have thus proposed the use of the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) technique, extend-ed with Data Warehousing data model design concepts to ex-tract a set of reuse-specific metrics for measuring the gains of reuse.

Many decision makers are now required to act near real-time, instead of periodically, given the latest transactional information. Decision-making occurs much more frequently and considers the latest business data. Since data warehouses (DWs) are the core of business intelligence, decision support systems need to deal with 24/7 real-time requirements. Thus, the ability to deal with continuous data loading and decision support availability simultaneously is critical, for producing continuous actionable knowledge. The main challenge in this context is to efficiently manage the DW’s refreshment, when data sources change, to recapture consistency and accuracy with those sources, while maintaining OLAP availability and database performance. This paper proposes a simple, fast and efficient solution based on database replication and temporary tables to change a traditional enterprise DW into a real-time DW, enabling continuous data loading and OLAP availability on a 24/7 schedule.

However, given the volume of data typically processed by DW queries, the existing encryption solutions heavily increase storage space and introduce very large overheads in query response time, due to decryption costs. In many cases, this performance degradation makes encryption unfeasible for use in DWs. In this paper we propose a transparent data masking solution for numerical values in DWs based on the mathematical modulus operator, which can be used without changing user application and DBMS source code. Our solution provides strong data security while introducing small overheads in both storage space and database performance. Several experimental evaluations using the TPC-H decision support benchmark and a real-world DW are included.

2853,78,"Leveraging 24/7 Availability and Performance for Distributed Real-Time Data Warehouses","Nowadays, most enterprises require near real-time Data Warehouses (DWs) that are able to deal with continuous updates while providing 24/7 availability. Distributed data using round-robin algorithms on clusters of shared-nothing machines is commonly used for improving performance. In this paper, we propose a solution for distributed DW databases that ensures its continuous availability and deals with frequent data loading requirements, introducing small performance overhead. We use a data striping and replication architecture to distribute portions of each fact table among pairs of slave nodes. Each slave node is an exact replica of its partner in the pair. This allows balancing query execution and replacing any defective node, ensuring the system’s continuous availability.

In fact, the lack of information on the internal state of the tested services and the complexity and variability of the responses analyzed, limits the effectiveness of such technique, highlighting the importance of evaluating and improving existing tools. The goal of this paper is to investigate if attack signatures and interface monitoring can be an effective mean to assess and improve the perfor-mance of penetration testing tools in web services environ-ments. In practice, attacks performed by such tools are signed and the interfaces between the target application and external resources are monitored (e.g., between services and a database server), allowing gathering additional information on existing vulnerabilities. A prototype was implemented focusing on SQL injection vulnerabilities. The experimental evaluation results clearly show that the proposed approach can be used in real scenarios.","Vulnerability Detection in Web Services","web-services, security, vulnerability detection, attack signatures, penetration testing, interface monitoring",2012-11-30,2012,1,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

Robustness is defined as the degree to which a system operates correctly in the presence of exceptional inputs or stressful environmental conditions. As triggering robustness faults could in the worst case scenario even crash the system, detecting this type of faults is of utmost importance. This chapter presents the state of the art on robustness testing by summarizing the evolution of basic robustness testing techniques, giving an overview of the specific methods and tools developed for major application domains, and introducing penetration testing, a specialization of robustness testing, which searches for security vulnerabilities. Finally, the use of testing results in resilience modelling and analysis is discussed.

Published research and best practice guides state that encryption is the best way to achieve this and maintain high performance. However, although encryption algorithms strongly fulfill their security purpose, we demonstrate that they introduce massive storage space and response time overheads, which mostly result in unacceptable security-performance tradeoffs, compromising their feasibility in DW environments. In this paper, we enumerate state-of-the-art data masking and encryption solutions and discuss the issues involving their use from a data warehousing perspective. Experimental evaluations using the TPC-H decision support benchmark and a real-world sales DW support our remarks, implemented in Oracle 11g and Microsoft SQL Server 2008. We conclude that the development of alternate solutions specifically tailored for DWs that are able to balance security with performance still remains a challenge and an open research issue.","Data Warehousing and Encryption Performance","Data masking, Encryption, Data security, Confidentiality, Database Performance, Data Warehousing",2012-09-06,2012,1,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4
3071,78,"DBMS Application Layer Intrusion Detection for Data Warehouses","Data Warehouses (DWs) are used for producing business knowledge and aiding decision support. Since they store the secrets of the business, securing their data is critical. To accomplish this, several Database Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) have been proposed. However, when using DIDS in DWs, most solutions either produce too many false positives (i.e. false alarms) that must be verified or too many false negatives (i.e. true intrusions that pass undetected). Moreover, many approaches detect intrusions a posteriori which, given the sensitivity of DW data, may result in irreparable cost. To the best of our knowledge, no DIDS specifically tailored for DWs has been proposed. This pa-per examines intrusion detection from a data warehousing perspective and the reasons why traditional database security methods are not sufficient to avoid in-trusions. We define the specific requirements for a DW DIDS and propose a conceptual approach for a real-time DIDS for DWs at the SQL command level that works transparently as an extension of the DataBase Management System &#40;DBMS&#41; between the user applications and the database server itself. A prelim-inary experimental evaluation using the TPC-H decision support benchmark is included to demonstrate the DIDS’ efficiency.","Intrusion Detection in Data Warehouses","Database intrusion detection systems, Database security, Anomaly detection, Misuse detection, Data warehousing",2012-08-31,2012,1,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

In this context, web-based connections to DWs are used by business management applications demanding continuous availability. Given that DWs store highly sensitive business data, a web-based connection provides a door for outside attackers and thus, creates a main security issue. Database Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) deal with intrusions in databases. However, given the distinct features of DW environments most DIDS either generate too many false alarms or too low intrusion detection rates. This paper proposes a real-time DIDS explicitly tailored for web-access DWs, functioning at the SQL command level as an extension of the DataBase Management System, using an SQL-like rule set and predefined checkups on well-defined DW features, which enable wide security coverage. We also propose a risk exposure method for ranking alerts which is much more effective than alert correlation techniques.","Intrusion Detection in Data Warehouses","Database security, Web security, Intrusion detection, Data warehouses",2012-11-30,2012,1,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

Modern intrusion detection systems (IDSes) for virtualized environments are deployed in the virtualization layer with components inside the virtual machine monitor (VMM) and the trusted host virtual machine (VM). Such IDSes can monitor at the same time the network and host activities of all guest VMs running on top of a VMM being isolated from malicious users of these VMs. We refer to IDSes for virtualized environments as VMM-based IDSes. In this work, we analyze state-of-the-art intrusion detection techniques applied in virtualized environments and architectures of VMM-based IDSes. Further, we identify challenges that apply specifically to benchmarking VMM-based IDSes focusing on workloads and metrics. For example, we discuss the challenge of defining representative baseline benign workload profiles as well as the challenge of defining malicious workloads containing attacks targeted at the VMM. We also discuss the impact of on-demand resource provisioning features of virtualized environments (e.g., CPU and memory hot plugging, memory ballooning) on IDS benchmarking measures such as capacity and attack detection accuracy. Finally, we outline future research directions in the area of benchmarking VMM-based IDSes and of intrusion detection in virtualized environments in general.

In 2009 EWDC was held in Toulouse, and in 2011 in Pisa.
EWDC 2013 focus on dependability and security of software and services. This is a challenging theme, especially when considering that information systems are more and more based on complex, heterogeneous, dynamic software and services, which are characterized by demanding quality attributes. Interoperability in the presence of dependability and security guarantees, as well as techniques and tools to assess the impact of accidental and malicious threats, are among the crucial aspects to be addressed.

To prevent these security problems from occurring it is of utmost importance to understand the typical software faults. This paper contributes to this body of knowledge by presenting a field study on two of the most widely spread and critical web application vulnerabilities: SQL Injection and XSS. It analyzes the source code of security patches of widely used web applications written in weak and strong typed languages. Results show that only a small subset of software fault types, affecting a restricted collection of statements, is related to security. In order to understand how these vulnerabilities are really exploited by hackers, this paper also presents an analysis of the source code of the scripts used to attack them. The outcomes of this study can be used to train software developers and code inspectors in the detection of such faults, and are also the foundation for the research of realistic vulnerability and attack injectors that can be used to assess security mechanisms, like intrusion detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and static code analyzers.",,,0000-00-00,2014,3,N,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

The experiments include the evaluation of coverage and false positives of an Intrusion Detection System for SQL Injection attacks and the assessment of the effectiveness of two top commercial web application vulnerability scanners.

We have tested the inter-operation of eleven client-side framework subsystems with three of the most widely used server-side implementations, each one hosting thousands of different services.

The problem is that, as web services are increasingly being deployed to support business-critical environments, interoperability issues may prevent or impact business transactions, potentially resulting in huge financial and reputation losses. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of the interoperability of 1024 publicly available web services, against a set of diverse and well-known client- side web service frameworks. We have detected at least one severe interoperability issue in over 54% of the services tested and quite different inter-operation capabilities regarding the client-side frameworks.

Modern virtualized service infrastructures expose attack vectors that enable attacks of high severity, such as attacks targeting hypervisors. A malicious user of a guest VM (virtual machine) may execute an attack against the underlying hypervisor via hypercalls, which are software traps from a kernel of a fully or partially paravirtualized guest VM to the hypervisor. The exploitation of a vulnerability of a hypercall handler may have severe consequences such as altering hypervisor’s memory, which may result in the execution of malicious code with hypervisor privilege. Despite the importance of vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers, there is not much publicly available information on them. This significantly hinders advances towards securing hypercall interfaces. In this work, we provide in-depth technical information on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers. Our vulnerability analysis is based on reverse engineering the released patches fixing the considered vulnerabilities. For each analyzed vulnerability, we provide background information essential for understanding the vulnerability, and information on the vulnerable hypercall handler and the error causing the vulnerability. We also show how the vulnerability can be triggered and discuss the state of the targeted hypervisor after the vulnerability has been triggered.

This means that securing them from data damage and information leakage is critical. In order to deal with intrusions against database systems, Database Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) are frequently used. This paper presents a survey on the main database intrusion detection techniques currently available and discusses the issues concerning their application at the database server layer. The identified weak spots show that most DIDS inadequately deal with many characteristics of specific database systems, such as ad hoc workloads and alert management issues in data warehousing environments, for example. Based on this analysis, research challenges are presented, and requirements and guidelines for the design of new or improved DIDS are proposed. The main finding is that the development and benchmarking of specifically tailored DIDS for the context in which they operate is a relevant issue and remains a challenge.

4040,78,"DBMS Application Layer Intrusion Detection for Data Warehouses","Data Warehouses (DWs) are used for producing business knowledge and aiding decision support. Since they store the secrets of the business, securing their data is critical. To accomplish this, several Database Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) have been proposed. However, when using DIDS in DWs, most solutions produce either too many false-positives (i.e., false alarms) that must be verified or too many false-negatives (i.e., true intrusions that pass undetected). Moreover, many approaches detect intrusions a posteriori which, given the sensitivity of DW data, may result in irreparable cost. To the best of our knowledge, no DIDS specifically tailored for DWs has been proposed. This paper examines intrusion detection from a data warehousing perspective and the reasons why traditional database security methods are not sufficient to avoid intrusions. We define the specific requirements for a DW DIDS and propose a conceptual approach for a real-time DIDS for DWs at the SQL command level that works transparently as an extension of the Database Management System &#40;DBMS&#41; between the user applications and the database server itself.

As a result, attackers are exploring vectors to attack hypervisors, against which an attack may be executed via several attack vectors such as device drivers, virtual machine exit events, or hypercalls, which enable  intrusions in hypervisors through their hypercall interfaces. Despite the importance, there is very limited publicly available information on vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers and attacks triggering them, which significantly hinders advances towards monitoring and securing these interfaces. In this experience report paper, we characterize the hypercall attack surface based on analyzing a set of vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers.

In particular, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks may inflict severe damage to web service providers, including financial and reputation losses. This way, it is vital that the software supporting services deployment (i.e., the web service framework) is able to provide a secure environment, so that the services can be delivered even when facing attacks. In this paper, we present an experimental approach that allows understanding how well a given web service framework is prepared to handle DoS attacks. The approach is based on a set of phases that include the execution of a large number of well-known DoS attacks against a target framework and the classification of the observed behavior. Results show that four out of the six frameworks tested are vulnerable to at least one type of DoS attack, and indicate that even very popular platforms require urgent security improvements",,"web services; security; web service frameworks; Denial of Service attacks; experimental assessment",2015-10-10,2015,3,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4
4316,78,"Towards assessing representativeness of fault injection-generated Failure Data for Online Failure Prediction","Online Failure Prediction allows improving system dependability by foreseeing incoming failures at runtime, enabling mitigation actions to be taken in advance, though prediction systems’ learning and assessing is hard due to the scarcity of failure data. Realistic software fault injection has been identified as a valid solution for addressing the scarcity of failure data, as injecting software faults (the most occurring on computer systems) increases the probability of a system to fail, hence allowing the collection of failure-related data in short time. Moreover, realistic injection permits the emulation of software faults likely to exist in the target system after its deployment.

Yet, there has been no quality attribute focused survey or classification of NoSQL databases where databases are compared with regards to their suitability for quality attributes common on the design of enterprise systems.

The problem is that V&V activities have to be implemented at runtime to fit the characteristics of SOA. Recent proposals of runtime V&V techniques specific to SOA domain are far from being complete and a key issue lies in understanding how the “failures propagate” in a dynamic system and how to continuously verify its evolving elements. This paper introduces
an approach to deal with the propagation of failures in a SOA environment. The proposed technique is based on three key steps: estimating the failure rate of the individual services, using fault injection to find the exposure of each service to failures from the invoked services, and estimating the impact of each service in the overall architecture. The overall approach is presented with a brief demonstration of its application.","Propagation of Failures in Service Oriented Architectures","failure propagation, fault injection, FMEA, Runtime V&V, SOA",2015-06-22,2015,1,Y,"Marco Vieira",mvieira@dei.uc.pt,78_mvieira3.jpg,1975-09-16,mvieira,4

We observed that a large percentage of faults fall in well-defined classes and can be characterized in a very precise way, allowing accurate emulation through a small set of mutation operators. The resulting operators closely emulate a broad range of common programmer mistakes.

776,80,"Generic Faultloads Based on Software Faults for Dependability Benchmarking","The most critical component of a dependability benchmark is the faultload, as it should represent a repeatable, portable, representative, and generally accepted set of faults. These properties are essential to achieve the desired standardization level required by a dependability benchmark but, unfortunately, are very hard to achieve. This is particularly true for software faults, which surely accounts for the fact that this important class of faults has never been used in known dependability benchmark proposals. This paper proposes a new methodology for the definition of faultloads based on software faults for dependability benchmarking. Our methodology builds on previous published results based on field data and uses a fault injection technique based on executable code mutation to emulate programming errors. Faultload properties such as repeatability, portability and scalability are also analyzed and validated through experimentation using a case study of dependability benchmarking of web servers. We concluded that software fault based faultloads generated using our methodology are appropriate and useful for dependability benchmarking. As our methodology is not tied to any specific software vendor or platform, it can be used to generate faultloads for the evaluation of any software product such as OLTP systems. Another important characteristic of the proposed methodology is the independence of source code availability. This allows us to generate faultloads appropriate for dependability evaluation of generic COTS software modules or systems.","Software Fault Emulation and Injection",,2004-09-28,2004,1,U,"Joao Duraes",jduraes@mail.isec.pt,./images/photos/80_,1970-08-26,jduraes,4

Although the interface faults injected by this approach can be considered as a possible consequence of actual software faults in real applications, the question of whether the typical exceptional inputs and invalid parameters used in these techniques do represent the consequences of software bugs is largely an open issue. This question may not be an issue in the context of robustness testing aimed at the identification of weaknesses in software components. However, the use of interface faults by API parameter corruption as a general approach for dependability evaluation in component-based systems requires an in depth study of interface faults and a close observation of the way internal component faults propagate to the component interfaces. In this work we present the results of experimental evaluation of realistic component-based applications developed in Java and C using the injection of interface faults by API parameter corruption and the injection of software faults inside the components by modification of the target code. The faults injected inside software components emulate typical programming errors and are based on an extensive field data study previously published.

Obviously, the same confidence and quality of the custom made software components is expected from the commercial applications. In most cases, such products (COTS) are not designed with stringent timing and/or safety requirements as priorities. Thus, to decrease the gap between the use of custom made components and COTS components, this paper presents a methodology for evaluating COTS products in the scope of dependable, real time systems, through the application of fault injection techniques at key points of the software engineering process. By combining the use of robustness testing (fault injection at interface level) with software fault injection (using educated fault injection operators), a COTS component can be assessed in the context of the system it will belong to, with special emphasis given to timing and safety constraints that are usually imposed by the target real time dependable environment.

Although these systems represent the best examples of business-critical systems, no practical way has been pro-posed so far to characterize and compare alternative solutions concerning dependability features. In fact, transac-tional systems industry holds a well established infrastructure for performance evaluation, where the benchmarks developed by the Transactional Performance Processing Council (TPC) represent the most important bench-marking initiative of all computer industry. However, as performance evaluation has been the main focus, de-pendability benchmarking of transactional systems has been largely disregarded over the years. This chapter proposes a dependability benchmark for OLTP application environments that specifies the measures and all components required to evaluate both the performance and key dependability features of OLTP systems, with particular emphasis on availability.

1419,80,"Experimental Risk Assessment and Comparison Using Software Fault Injection","One important question in component-based software development is how to estimate the risk of using COTS components, as the components may have hidden faults and typically the source code is not available for analysis. This question is particularly relevant in scenarios where it is necessary to choose the most reliable COTS when several alternative components of equivalent functionality are available. The estimated risk introduced in the system by each component can help the system integrator in such cases. This paper proposes a practical approach to assess the risk of using a given software component (COTS or non COTS). Although we focus on comparing components, the methodology can be useful to assess the risk in individual modules. The proposed approach uses the injection of realistic residual software faults to assess the impact of possible component failures and uses software complexity metrics to estimate the probability of residual defects in software components.

2448,80,"Towards Identifying the Best Variables for Failure Prediction Using Injection of Realistic Software Faults","Predicting failures at runtime is one of the most promising techniques to increase the availability of computer systems. However, failure prediction algorithms are still far from providing satisfactory results. In particular, the identification of the variables that show symptoms of incoming failures is a difficult problem. In this paper we propose an approach for identifying the most adequate variables for failure prediction. Realistic software faults are injected to accelerate the occurrence of system failures and thus generate a large amount of failure related data that is used to select, among hundreds of system variables, a small set that exhibits a clear correlation with failures. The proposed approach was experimentally evaluated using two configurations based on Windows XP. Results show that the proposed approach is quite effective and easy to use and that the injection of software faults is a powerful tool for improving the state of the art on failure prediction.",Dependability,"Failure prediction, availability, fault injection, software faults",2011-02-23,2010,1,U,"Joao Duraes",jduraes@mail.isec.pt,./images/photos/80_,1970-08-26,jduraes,4

However, runtime computer systems evolution requires the online generation of training data. The problem is that using fault injection in a production environment is unacceptable. Virtualization is a cheap sand boxing solution that may be used to run multiple copies of a system, over which fault injection can be safely applied. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that the data generated in the virtualized environment can be used for training the algorithms that will run in the original system. In this work we study the similarity of failure data obtained in the two scenarios, considering different virtualized environments. Results show that the data share key characteristics, suggesting virtualization as a viable solution to be further researched.",Dependability,"fault injection, online failure prediction, virtualization",2013-04-01,2013,1,Y,"Joao Duraes",jduraes@mail.isec.pt,./images/photos/80_,1970-08-26,jduraes,4
3658,80,"On Fault Representativeness of Software Fault Injection","The injection of software faults in software components to assess the impact of these faults on other components or on the system as a whole, allowing the evaluation of fault tolerance, is relatively new compared to decades of research on hardware fault injection. This paper presents an extensive experimental study (more than 3.8 million individual experiments in three real systems) to evaluate the representativeness of faults injected by a state-of-the-art approach (G-SWFIT). Results show that a significant share (up to 72 percent) of injected faults cannot be considered representative of residual software faults as they are consistently detected by regression tests, and that the representativeness of injected faults is affected by the fault location within the system, resulting in different distributions of representative/nonrepresentative faults across files and functions. Therefore, we propose a new approach to refine the faultload by removing faults that are not representative of residual software faults. This filtering is essential to assure meaningful results and to reduce the cost (in terms of number of faults) of software fault injection campaigns in complex software. The proposed approach is based on classification algorithms, is fully automatic, and can be used for improving fault representativeness of existing software fault injection approaches.","Software Fault Injection","Fault injection, Software faults, Fault representativeness",2013-01-02,2013,3,U,"Joao Duraes",jduraes@mail.isec.pt,./images/photos/80_,1970-08-26,jduraes,4

The major advantage of ESFFI over other techniques that also emulate software faults (mutations, for instance) is making fault locations ubiquitous; every software module can be targeted no matter if it is a device driver running in operating kernel mode or a 3rd party component whose source code is not available.

Results revealed the limitations of Xception (and other SWIFI tools) in the emulation of different classes of software faults (about 44% of the software faults cannot be emulated). The use of field data about real faults was discussed and software metrics were suggested as an alternative to guide the injection process when field data is not available. In a second experiment, a set of rules for the injection of errors meant to emulate classes of software faults was evaluated. The fault triggers used seem to be the cause for the observed strong impact of the faults in the target system and in the program results. The results also show the influence in the fault emulation of aspects such as code size, complexity of data structures, and recursive versus sequential execution.","Software Fault Emulation",,2000-06-25,2000,1,U,"Diamantino Costa",dino@criticalsoftware.com,./images/photos/83_,1969-01-01,dino,4

This class of programs include online transaction processing, elec-tronic commerce, Internet/World Wide Web, data warehousing, decision support, online analytical processing (OLAP), control systems, and other business-critical solutions for the finance, retail, and healthcare markets. These consist mainly in server applications of the business world that runs 24 hours a day, i.e. run perpetually providing a service to its clients, demanding high availability, or/and applications that manage business critical data requiring high levels of data integrity. Traditionally, this software runs in highly specialized machines with special operating system support in order to provide the required levels of dependability through fault tolerance [6] [7]. Using off-the-shelf cheap PC's and operating systems without any fault tolerance support for this purpose, as is seen nowadays, can be risky, unreliable and dangerous.
This article presents a library, named WinFT, that provides fault tolerance support for Win32 applications (Windows95/NT) that need high levels of dependability. In this approach, fault tolerance is totally software imple-mented and enables the detection and recovery of software faults (bugs) that cause processes to crash or hang as well as faults in the underlying operating system and hardware that are not handled by the O.S. and hardware them-selves. Basically, WinFT performs automatic detection and restart of failed processes, diagnostic and reboot of a malfunctioning or strangled operating system, checkpointing and recovery of critical volatile data and preventive actions such as software rejuvenation. WinFT was employed successfully in real time control applications for indus-try based on personal computers running Windows 95 in a workgroup environment.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems",,1997-02-01,1997,3,U,"Diamantino Costa",dino@criticalsoftware.com,./images/photos/83_,1969-01-01,dino,4

Additionally, due to the intrinsic criticality of this type of systems, the failure of a given component might mean the loss of the mission. Nowadays, one can observe that off-the-shelf (OTS) components (or commercial off-the-shelf - COTS) are being used in onboard space systems (e.g. operating systems, run time libraries, etc.) in order to reduce project costs. The use of OTS components in real time safety critical applications may increase the failure probability, since these components are not designed and developed for environment with strict timing and/or safety requirements. The assessment approach proposed in this paper is based on the joint use of robustness testing (interface fault injection) and a particular fault injection technique named G-SWFIT that injects realistic software faults. The proposed toolset is meant both for 1) revealing OTS components vulnerabilities, which is suitable to be used early in the system life cycle, and 2) assess the impact of component failures in the entire system, within the 1st steps of validation.

validation and presents the architecture of a pin-level fault injector called RIFLE. This system can be adapted to a wide range of target systems and the faults are mainly injected in the processor pins. The injection of the faults is deterministic and can be reproduced if needed. Faults of different nature can be injected and the fault injector is able to detect whether the injected fault has produced an error or not without the requirement of feedback circuits. RIFLE can also detect specific circumstances in which the injected faults do not affect the target system. Sets of faults with specific impact on the target system can be generated. The paper also presents fault injection results showing the coverage and latency achieved with a set of simple behavior based error detection mechanisms. It is shown that up to 72,5% of the errors can be detected with fairly simple mechanisms. Furthermore, for over 90% of the faults the target system has behaved according to the fail-silent model, which suggests that a traditional computer equipped
with simple error detection mechanisms is relatively close to a fail-silent computer.","Fault Injection","Pin-level Fault Injection",1994-10-01,1994,1,U,"F. Moreira",fmoreira@criticalsoftware.com,./images/photos/85_,1975-01-01,,4

As a starting point of the project, this report surveys and comments on the state-of-the-art techniques in selected areas that we have currently identified to be pertinent for the activity of conducting the benchmarking process.
The areas covered encompass defining the context of benchmarking and its conjunction with issues of dependability. These include aspects of dependability assessment (such as analytical modelling, fault injection and field measurement), performance benchmarking and robustness benchmarking. For each area, several techniques and problems relevant to dependability benchmarking are identified, including areas requiring more research. This report compiles our current opinions on the topics and establishes the background for further DBench activities.
The survey identifies that representativeness is a key feature, since it is important both for fault injection experiments as well as for performance benchmarks. 
Another insight derived from the survey is the importance of considering dependability in association with functionality and performance attributes of the systems ' a stand-alone interpretation of dependability is probably not an objective property of any system. Furthermore, past experience has shown using a combined experimental and modelling approach to been successful in assessing computer system dependability. Accordingly, applying this to dependability benchmarking is also of interest, and warrants further research.
Finally, the problem of presenting relevant results to the users of a benchmark is an important facet. Performance benchmarks have typically employed a policy of presenting a few easy to understand metrics to the benchmark user. This has been a successful approach as benchmark users are not required to be experts on the subject.

36,87,"State of the Art","The DBench (Dependability Benchmarking) project aims at formulating a conceptual framework for benchmarking the dependability of COTS and COTS-based systems. As a starting point of the project, this report surveys and comments on the state-of-the-art techniques in selected areas that we have currently identified to be pertinent for the activity of conducting the benchmarking process.
The areas covered encompass defining the context of benchmarking and its conjunction with issues of dependability. These include aspects of dependability assessment (such as analytical modelling, fault injection and field measurement), performance benchmarking and robustness benchmarking. For each area, several techniques and problems relevant to dependability benchmarking are identified, including areas requiring more research. This report compiles our current opinions on the topics and establishes the background for further DBench activities.
The survey identifies that representativeness is a key feature, since it is important both for fault injection experiments as well as for performance benchmarks. 
Another insight derived from the survey is the importance of considering dependability in association with functionality and performance attributes of the systems ' a stand-alone interpretation of dependability is probably not an objective property of any system. Furthermore, past experience has shown using a combined experimental and modelling approach to been successful in assessing computer system dependability. Accordingly, applying this to dependability benchmarking is also of interest, and warrants further research.
Finally, the problem of presenting relevant results to the users of a benchmark is an important facet. Performance benchmarks have typically employed a policy of presenting a few easy to understand metrics to the benchmark user. This has been a successful approach as benchmark users are not required to be experts on the subject. However, the basic issue here is ascertain the technical value of a benchmark with r","Dependability benchmarking",,2001-08-01,2001,8,U,"J. Arlat",arlat@laas.fr,./images/photos/87_,1975-01-01,,4
37,87,"Preliminary Dependability Benchmark Framework","The goal of dependability benchmarking is to provide generic ways of characterising the behaviour of components and computer systems in the presence of faults, allowing for the quantification of dependability measures. Beyond existing evaluation techniques, dependability benchmarking must provide a uniform, repeatable and cost-effective way of performing this evaluation either as stand alone assessment or more often for comparative evaluation across systems. This document presents the preliminary framework proposed by the DBench project to investigate, define, and validate dependability benchmarks for computer systems, with particular emphasis on COTS-based systems and COTS components. The multiple dimensions of the problem are discussed and the framework is presented through a set of dependability benchmarking scenarios, ranging from pure experimental approaches to benchmarking scenarios where modelling and experimentation are tightly coupled. The main problems and research goals behind each benchmarking scenario are discussed and two concrete examples of preliminary dependability benchmarks already under investigation are presented.","Dependability benchmarking",,2001-08-01,2001,8,U,"J.

Fault injection has been widely used for this purpose, however with the rapid increase in processor complexity, traditional techniques are also increasingly more difficult to apply. This paper presents a new software implemented fault injection and monitoring environment, called Xception, which is targeted for the modern and complex processors. Xception uses the advanced debugging and performance monitoring features existing in most of the modern processors to inject quite realistic faults by software, and to monitor the activation of the faults and their impact on the target system behavior in detail. Faults are injected with minimum interference with the target application. The target application is not modified, no software traps are inserted, and it is not necessary to execute the target application in special trace mode (the application is executed at full speed). Xception provides a comprehensive set of fault triggers, including spatial and temporal fault triggers, and triggers related to the manipulation of data in memory. Faults injected by Xception can affect any process running on the target system (including the kernel), and it is possible to inject faults in applications for which the source code is not available. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and potential of Xception in the evaluation of the dependability properties of the complex computer systems available nowadays.","Fault Injection",,1998-02-01,1998,3,U,"João Carreira",jcar@criticalsoftware.com,./images/photos/88_,1975-01-01,jcar,4

This class of programs include online transaction processing, elec-tronic commerce, Internet/World Wide Web, data warehousing, decision support, online analytical processing (OLAP), control systems, and other business-critical solutions for the finance, retail, and healthcare markets. These consist mainly in server applications of the business world that runs 24 hours a day, i.e. run perpetually providing a service to its clients, demanding high availability, or/and applications that manage business critical data requiring high levels of data integrity. Traditionally, this software runs in highly specialized machines with special operating system support in order to provide the required levels of dependability through fault tolerance [6] [7]. Using off-the-shelf cheap PC's and operating systems without any fault tolerance support for this purpose, as is seen nowadays, can be risky, unreliable and dangerous.
This article presents a library, named WinFT, that provides fault tolerance support for Win32 applications (Windows95/NT) that need high levels of dependability. In this approach, fault tolerance is totally software imple-mented and enables the detection and recovery of software faults (bugs) that cause processes to crash or hang as well as faults in the underlying operating system and hardware that are not handled by the O.S. and hardware them-selves. Basically, WinFT performs automatic detection and restart of failed processes, diagnostic and reboot of a malfunctioning or strangled operating system, checkpointing and recovery of critical volatile data and preventive actions such as software rejuvenation. WinFT was employed successfully in real time control applications for indus-try based on personal computers running Windows 95 in a workgroup environment.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems",,1997-02-01,1997,3,U,"João Carreira",jcar@criticalsoftware.com,./images/photos/88_,1975-01-01,jcar,4

The results showed that a significant percentage of faults caused the system to produce wrong results while the application seemed to terminate normally, thus demonstrating that fault tolerance techniques are required in parallel systems, not only to assure that long-running applications can terminate but also (and more important) that the results produced are correct. Of the techniques tested to reduce the percentage of undetected wrong results only ABFT proved to be effective. For other simple error detection methods to be effective, they have to be designed in, and not added as an after thought.

It consists of a number of assertions that can be executed on the results of the computation to determine their correctness. The proposed scheme follows the Result Checking principle, since it does not depend on the particular numerical algorithm used. It can handle both real and complex matrices, symmetric or not. Many practical issues are handled, like rounding errors and eigenvalue ordering, and a practical implementation was built on top of unmodified routines of the well-known LAPACK library. The proposed scheme is simultaneously very efficient, with less than 2% performance overhead for medium to large matrices, very effective, since it exhibited a fault coverage greater than 99.7% with a confidence level of 99%, when subjected to extensive fault-injection experiments, and very easy to adapt to other libraries of mathematical routines besides LAPACK.","Result Checking","Result Checking, Fault Injection, Assertions, Eigenproblem,",1999-09-15,1999,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

A less well known alternative is called Result Checking (RC) where, contrary to ABFT, results are checked without knowledge of the particular algorithm used to calculate them.
In this paper a comparison is made between the two using some practical implementations of matrix computations. The criteria are performance and memory overhead, ease of use and error coverage. For the latter extensive error injection experiments were made. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that RC is validated by fault injection.
We conclude that Result Checking has the important advantage of being independent of the underlying algorithm. It also has generally less performance overhead than ABFT, the two techniques being essentially equivalent in terms of error coverage.","Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance","Result-checking, ABFT, Fault injection, Error Detection, Matrix operations.",1999-06-15,1999,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

Besides the problem of roundoff error in floating point arithmetic, we identify two further weakpoints, namely lack of protection of data during input and output, and incorrect execution of the correctness checks. We propose the Robust ABFT technique to handle those weakpoints. We then generalize it to programs that use assertions, where similar problems arise, leading to the technique of Robust Assertions, whose effectiveness is shown by fault injection experiments on a realistic control application. With this technique a system follows a new failure model, that we call Fail-Bounded, where with high probability all results produced are either correct or, if wrong, they are within a certain bound of the correct value, whose exact value depends on the output assertions used. We claim that this failure model is very useful to describe the behavior of many low redundancy systems.","Failure Models","Failure models, assertions, ABFTs, error detection methods, fault injection.",1998-06-23,1998,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

313,89,"Providing Applications With Mobile Agent Technology","Over the last couple of years we have been working on the development of mobile agents systems and its application to the areas of telecommunications and network management. This work path produced positive results: a competitive mobile agent platform was built, the run-time benefits of mobile agents were proved, and our industrial partners have developed practical applications that are being integrated into commercial products. However, despite the positive results, we feel that mobile agent technology is still not ready to enter the path of mainstream software development. In our perspective, one of the main reasons for this situation arises from the traditional approach to mobile agent technology. This approach, based on the familiar concept of the mobile-agent distributed platform as an extension of the operating system, focuses too much on the mobile agents and associated issues (mobility, agent lifecycle, security, coordination, etc.) and provides poor support for the development of applications where mobile agents are just one of several available technologies. Learning from past experience, we are now working on a new approach where the focus is brought back to the applications and mobile agents become just one the tools available to develop distributed systems. This provides a much lighter framework for application-based mobile agent systems.

One difficult aspect of this work is that all the features must work with the security mechanisms that already exist on the applications. This is so because the components are integrated from within into the applications, which already have security mechanisms in place.

Benchmarks with that objective must include fault injectors that are very simple to use. They should be downloadable from the web together with the other components of the benchmark, be able to target all system components, and should not require any complex setup or installation procedure. Since the existing injectors did not fulfill this requirement, we have developed DBench-FI, a fault injector for dependability benchmarking that is very simple to install and use. DBench-FI belongs to the software implemented fault injection (SWIFI) family, since no special hardware can be used for this purpose. The current version targets the Linux OS on Intel processors, and uses a flexible runtime kernel upgrading algorithm to allow access to the target process memory space, that can be in either user or system space, enabling in this way the injection of faults. Furthermore, it does not require the availability of the source code of any system component or user process. It is not based on any debug mode either, being able to inject faults even in tasks that were already running when it is installed, irrespective of their complexity, like the Oracle Database Management System that is used in the examples in the paper. This set of features is, to the best of our knowledge, unique. It currently only injects memory faults, but there are plans to include other fault models in the future. In order to demonstrate the capability of the DBench-FI tool, the results of complex fault injection campaigns are presented.","Software Fault Emulation","SWIFI, Dependability Benchmarking",2003-10-21,2003,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4
362,89,"M&M's: Building Binary Software Components for Supporting Mobile-Agent Enabled Applications","Mobile Agents provide a new promising paradigm for developing distributed applications. Nevertheless, although the basic concept has been around for some years, and many agent platforms are available both from the industry and research community, there are currently few examples where the technology has been deployed in the real world. One important reason for this is that using the current available agent frameworks it is quite difficult to develop applications without having to center them completely on the agents and on the agent infrastructure. In this paper, we present the M&M project, taking place at the University of Coimbra. In this project, we are developing an extensive component-based framework that enables ordinary applications to use mobile agents in a flexible and easy way. By using this approach, applications can be developed using current object-oriented approaches and become able of sending and receiving agents by the simple drag and drop of mobility components. The framework was implemented using the JavaBeans component model and provides integration with ActiveX, which allows applications to be written in a wide variety of programming languages. By using this framework, the development of applications that can make use of mobile agents is greatly simplified, which can contribute to a wider spreading of the mobile agent technology.","Mobile Agents",,2002-03-01,2002,3,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4
363,89,"A Framework for Smart Proxies and Interceptors in RMI","The Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) API shields the developer from the details of distributed programming, allowing him to concentrate on application specific code. But to perform some operations that are orthogonal to the application, like logging, auditing, caching, QoS, fault tolerance, and security, sometimes it is necessary to customize the default behavior of the RMI runtime. Other middleware for distributed programming, like CORBA and the Remoting framework of the .NET platform, support smart proxies and interceptors, which can be used for these purposes, allowing the separation of application-specific code from service-specific code. In RMI there is no direct way of doing so. This paper presents a framework based on the Dynamic Proxy API for using smart proxies and interceptors with RMI. This framework requires no changes in the client application and minimal changes in the server application, giving the developer greater control over the distributed application. A practical example of use is also given, by using the described framework to implement user authentication and fine-grained access control in RMI.","Distributed Systems",,2002-09-01,2002,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

They are autonomous, have a strong sense of location and are able to operate independently of a central server. Nevertheless, although this is true, for developing a mobile agent system that is capable of operating in a disconnected computing environment, much more is needed: persistence stores where the agents can be safely stored; agent reactivation mechanisms, which allow agents to migrate when a network connection is detected; policies and notification mechanisms for dealing with changing locations; among other things. In this paper, we present the mechanisms developed for the M&M mobile agent framework in order to address mobile and disconnected computing environments.

429,89,"Can Software Implemented Fault-Injection be used on Real-Time Systems?","Software Implemented Fault Injection (SWIFI) is a well-established technique for fault injection, but with a significant drawback for Real-Time Systems: intrusiveness, also known as 'probe effectâ?. In fact, for most fault models, additional code has to be run on the same processor that executes the application. The danger lies in some deadlines being missed as a consequence of that overhead.
This paper identifies the sources of intrusiveness, and discusses the procedures to measure it. The question of what level of intrusiveness can be considered acceptable is also addressed.
A Pentium version of an existing SWIFI tool (Xception), developed with no real-time considerations in mind, was tested on a system composed by off the shelf (COTS) components (a standard PC with a Pentium processor and a commercial real time multitasking kernel). Data collected using this platform shows that the intrusiveness can be quite significant.
A technique called ""Routine Specialization"" is proposed to lower that overhead. Results obtained from a 'real time orientedâ? injector (RT-Xception) taken from the same system, show a very significant improvement. A comparison with data from other authors shows that with this change SWIFI becomes a viable technique for a wide range of real-time applications.","Software Fault Emulation and Injection","fault-injection, real-time, dependability evaluation",1999-09-15,1999,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4
430,89,"Software-Implemented Stable Storage in Main Memory","Stable storage is a type of memory whose contents must survive system malfunctions. It is a key element for fault tolerant systems to perform checkpointing and rollback-recovery. It is usually implemented using hard disks, because of its non-volatile characteristics and robustness against processor faults. However, for many control systems, the low speed and unpredictability of disks are not acceptable due to real-time constraints or, specially on embedded systems, disks are simply not available. In such cases, main memory should be used.
In this paper we present and test a stable storage mechanism relying exclusively on local main memory, and able to survive processor malfunctions. We show that by a careful use of some very common features of processors, like memory protection, we can obtain very high data survivability to system crashes. The study was conducted on COTS computers and a commercial real-time executive running two sample applications, which were subjected to intensive fault injection campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that software-implemented stable storage in RAM has been presented and tested by fault injection.","Stabe Storage","Stable Storage, Fault-Injection, COTS",2001-03-05,2001,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

This paper investigates whether this resilience also extends to disturbances originating from faults in the controller itself. The question of what kind of failure model is more effective in this type of system is addressed, with three different models being studied: arbitrary failure, fail silent, and fail-bounded.
The study is conducted essentially by experimental fault-injection in the controller of one of the best known and most demanding of the benchmarks used in the control systems area: an inverted pendulum. The considered failure models are compared according to criteria based on the quality of the control action. Other insights gained from the experiments made are described, for instance on how to significantly increase dependability at a very low-cost in feedback controllers, and on the need for a different kind of real-time scheduling algorithms.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","System Fault-Tolerance, Fault-Injection, Real-Time, Failure Models, Feedback Control Systems",2001-06-30,2001,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

468,89,"On the Use of Disaster Prediction for Failure-Tolerance in Feedback Control Systems","Feedback control algorithms are inherently designed to compensate for external disturbances that the controlled system may suffer. This resilience is also extensible to late or wrong control actions produced by a failed controller computer, providing a degree of fault tolerance without the use of any particular mechanism. However, some controller failures, due to their duration or value, may indeed collapse the system, and thus other recovery measures must be taken.
This paper proposes the inclusion of an Oracle that calculates, in a timely manner, the controlled system behavior under a failed controller, and triggers recovery when the control algorithm is predictably no more able to compensate for a particular controller failure. The systems so built follow the Fail-Bounded model. The main contribution of this paper is to show how this model can be implemented in a practical way for the very important class of applications based on feedback control, thus turning that model into a technique that can be used effectively to build production systems.
The method was validated experimentally through fault injection on the controller computer of an inverted pendulum, one of the most time-demanding control system benchmarks.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","Feedback control system, real-time, failure-tolerance, disaster prediction, evaluation",2002-06-23,2002,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4
469,89,"Reset-Driven Fault Tolerance","A common approach in embedded systems to achieve fault-tolerance is to reboot the computer whenever some non-permanent error is detected. All the system code and data are recreated from scratch, and a previously established checkpoint, hopefully not corrupted, is used to restart the application data. The confidence is thus restored on the activity of the computer.
The idea explored in this paper is that of unconditionally resetting the computer in each control frame (the classic read sensors -> calculate control action -> update actuators cycle). A stable-storage based in RAM is used to preserve the system's state between consecutive cleanups and a standard watchdog timer guarantees that a reset is forced whenever an error crashes the system.
We have evaluated this approach by using fault-injection in the controller of a standard temperature control system. The experimental observations show that the Reset-Driven Fault Tolerance is a very simple yet effective technique to improve reliability at an extremely low cost since it is a conceptually simple, software only solution with the advantage of being application independent.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","reset-driven fault tolerance, fault removal, dependability, embedded real-time systems",2002-10-23,2002,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

validation and presents the architecture of a pin-level fault injector called RIFLE. This system can be adapted to a wide range of target systems and the faults are mainly injected in the processor pins. The injection of the faults is deterministic and can be reproduced if needed. Faults of different nature can be injected and the fault injector is able to detect whether the injected fault has produced an error or not without the requirement of feedback circuits. RIFLE can also detect specific circumstances in which the injected faults do not affect the target system. Sets of faults with specific impact on the target system can be generated. The paper also presents fault injection results showing the coverage and latency achieved with a set of simple behavior based error detection mechanisms. It is shown that up to 72,5% of the errors can be detected with fairly simple mechanisms. Furthermore, for over 90% of the faults the target system has behaved according to the fail-silent model, which suggests that a traditional computer equipped
with simple error detection mechanisms is relatively close to a fail-silent computer.","Fault Injection","Pin-level Fault Injection",1994-10-01,1994,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

Fault injection has been widely used for this purpose, however with the rapid increase in processor complexity, traditional techniques are also increasingly more difficult to apply. This paper presents a new software implemented fault injection and monitoring environment, called Xception, which is targeted for the modern and complex processors. Xception uses the advanced debugging and performance monitoring features existing in most of the modern processors to inject quite realistic faults by software, and to monitor the activation of the faults and their impact on the target system behavior in detail. Faults are injected with minimum interference with the target application. The target application is not modified, no software traps are inserted, and it is not necessary to execute the target application in special trace mode (the application is executed at full speed). Xception provides a comprehensive set of fault triggers, including spatial and temporal fault triggers, and triggers related to the manipulation of data in memory. Faults injected by Xception can affect any process running on the target system (including the kernel), and it is possible to inject faults in applications for which the source code is not available. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and potential of Xception in the evaluation of the dependability properties of the complex computer systems available nowadays.","Fault Injection",,1998-02-01,1998,3,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

985,89,"WinFT: Software Implemented Fault Tolerance for Win32 Applications.","The increasing number of existing business critical applications targeted for the low end PC market and general purpose operating systems such as Microsoft windows 95/NT poses the problem of guaranteeing continuous avail-ability and data  integrity for those applications. This class of programs include online transaction processing, elec-tronic commerce, Internet/World Wide Web, data warehousing, decision support, online analytical processing (OLAP), control systems, and other business-critical solutions for the finance, retail, and healthcare markets. These consist mainly in server applications of the business world that runs 24 hours a day, i.e. run perpetually providing a service to its clients, demanding high availability, or/and applications that manage business critical data requiring high levels of data integrity. Traditionally, this software runs in highly specialized machines with special operating system support in order to provide the required levels of dependability through fault tolerance [6] [7]. Using off-the-shelf cheap PC's and operating systems without any fault tolerance support for this purpose, as is seen nowadays, can be risky, unreliable and dangerous.
This article presents a library, named WinFT, that provides fault tolerance support for Win32 applications (Windows95/NT) that need high levels of dependability. In this approach, fault tolerance is totally software imple-mented and enables the detection and recovery of software faults (bugs) that cause processes to crash or hang as well as faults in the underlying operating system and hardware that are not handled by the O.S. and hardware them-selves. Basically, WinFT performs automatic detection and restart of failed processes, diagnostic and reboot of a malfunctioning or strangled operating system, checkpointing and recovery of critical volatile data and preventive actions such as software rejuvenation. WinFT was employed successfully in real time control applications for indus-try based on personal computers running Windows 95 in a workgroup environment.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems",,1997-02-01,1997,3,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

988,89,"Experimental Assessment of Parallel Systems","In the research reported in this paper, transient faults were injected in the nodes and in the communication subsystem (by using software fault injection) of a commercial parallel machine running several real applications. The results showed that a significant percentage of faults caused the system to produce wrong results while the application seemed to terminate normally, thus demonstrating that fault tolerance techniques are required in parallel systems, not only to assure that long-running applications can terminate but also (and more important) that the results produced are correct. Of the techniques tested to reduce the percentage of undetected wrong results only ABFT proved to be effective. For other simple error detection methods to be effective, they have to be designed in, and not added as an after thought. Faults injected in the communication subsystem proved the effectiveness of end-to-end CRCs on the data movements between processors.","Parallel and Distributed Computing",,1996-06-25,1996,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

Xception uses the advanced debugging and performance monitoring features existing in most of the modern processors to inject more realistic faults by software, and to monitor the activation of the faults and their impact on the target system behaviour in detail. Faults are injected with minimum interference with the target application. The target application is not modified,
no software traps are inserted, and it is not necessary to execute it in special trace mode (the application is executed at full speed). Xception provides a comprehensive set of fault triggers, including spatial and temporal fault triggers, and triggers related to the manipulation of data in memory. Faults injected by Xception can affect any process running on the target system including the operating system. Sets of faults can be defined by the user according to several criteria, including the emulation of faults in specific target processor functional units. Presently, Xception has been implemented on a parallel machine build around the PowerPC 601 processor running the PARIX operating system. Experiment results are presented showing the impact of faults on several parallel applications running on a commercial parallel system. It is shown that up to 73% of the faults, depending on the processor functional unit affected, can cause the application to produce wrong results. The results show that the impact of faults heavily depends on the application and the specific processor functional unit affected by the fault.",,,1995-09-27,1995,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

coordinated global checkpoint, but only a minimum overhead is imposed during normal computation. Messages can be delivered out-of-order, and the processes are not required to be deterministic. The non-blocking structure is an important characteristic to avoid laying an heavy burden on the application programs.
Our proposal also includes the damage assessment phase, unlike previous schemes that either assume that an error is detected immediately after it occurs (fail-stop) or simply ignore
the damage caused by imperfect detection mechanisms.

997,89,"Experimental evaluation of the fail-silent behavior in computers without error masking","Traditionally, fail-silent computers are implemented by
using massive redundancy (hardware or software). In this
research we investigate if it is possible to obtain a high
degree of fail-silent behavior from a computer without
hardware or software replication by using only simple
behavior based error detection techniques. It is assumed
that if the errors caused by a fault are detected in time it
will be possible to stop the erroneous computer behavior,
thus preventing the violation of the fail-silent model. The
evaluation technique used in this research is physical fault
injection at the pin level. Results obtained by the injection
of about 20000 different faults in two different target
systems have shown that 1) in a system without error
detection up to 46% of the faults caused the violation of
the fail-silent model; 2) in a computer with behavior
based error detection the percentage of faults that caused
the violation of the fail-silent mode was reduced to values
from 2.3% to 0.4%; 3) the results are very dependent on
the target system, on the program under execution during
the fault injection and on the type of faults.","Fault Injection",,1994-06-26,1994,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

1336,89,"Sharing Checkpoints to Improve Turnaround Time in Desktop Grid","In this paper, we present a checkpoint sharing methodology to improve turnaround time of applications run over desktop grid environments. In fact, volatility of desktop grid nodes reduces the efficiency of such environments when a fast turnaround time is sought, since a task might get stalled if its assigned machine remains unavailable for a somewhat long period of time (long at the scale of the computation). The rationale behind our approach is to permit checkpoint reuse, so that when a computation is forced to move from one node to another, it can be restarted from an intermediary point provided by the last saved checkpoint.
We study the effects of sharing checkpoints in application turnaround time simulating three scheduling algorithms based on First Come First Served: FCFS, FCFS AT and FCFS TR. The targeted environment consists of institutional desktop grids. 

Our results show that sharing checkpoints is particularly effective in volatile environments, yielding performance improvement up to three times relatively to schemes based on private checkpoints. Furthermore, for non volatile environments, a simple timeout strategy produces good results.",,"desktop grid, checkpointing, turnaround time",2006-04-18,2006,1,U,"João Gabriel Silva",jgabriel@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/89_fotojg.jpg,1957-06-27,jgabriel,4

Quite often, data warehouse administrators are lead to data models with little room for performance improvement. However, the increasing demands for interactive response time from the users make query performance one of the central problems of data warehousing today. In this paper we defend that data warehouse design must take into account both the business and the performance perspective from the beginning, and we propose the extension to typical design methodologies to include performance concerns in the early design steps. Specific analysis to predicted data warehouse usage profile and meta-data analysis are proposed as new inputs for improving the transition from logical to physical schema. The proposed approach is illustrated and discussed using the TPC-H performance benchmark and it is shown that significant performance improvement can be achieved without jeopardizing the business view required for data warehouse models.","Data Warehousing",,2002-09-02,2002,1,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4

Examples are materialized views, join indexes, B-tree and bitmap indexes. This paper proposes dimension-join, a new type of index especially suited for data warehouses. The dimension-join borrows ideas from several concepts. It is both a bitmap index and a multi-table join and when being used one of the tables is not read to improve performance. It is a multi-table join because it holds information belonging to two tables, which is similar to the join index proposed by Valduriez. However, instead of being composed by the tables primary keys, the dimension-join index is also a bitmap index over the fact table using values from a dimension column. The dimension-join index is very useful when selecting facts depending of dimension tables belonging to snowflakes. The dimension-join represents a direct connection between the fact table and a table in the snowflake that can avoid several joins and produce enormous performance improvements. This paper also evaluates experimentally the dimension-join indexes using the TPC-H benchmark and shows that this new index structure can dramatically improve the performance for some queries.","Data Warehousing",,2001-10-01,2001,1,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4

1345,92,"Adaptive Query Processing in the Looking Glass,","A great deal of work on adaptive query pro- 
cessing has been done over the last few years: 
Adaptive query processing has been used to de- 
tect and correct optimizer errors due to incor- 
rect statistics or simplified cost metrics; it has 
been applied to long-running continuous queries 
over data streams whose characteristics vary over 
time; and routing-based adaptive query process- 
ing does away with the optimizer altogether. De- 
spite this large body of interrelated work, no uni- 
fying comparison of adaptive query processing 
techniques or systems has been attempted; we 
tackle this problem. We identify three families 
of systems (plan-based, CQ-based, and routing- 
based), and compare them in detail with respect 
to the most important aspects of adaptive query 
processing: plan quality, statistics monitoring and 
re-optimization, plan migration, and scalability. 
We also suggest two new approaches to adap- 
tive query processing that address some of the 
shortcomings revealed by our in-depth analysis: 
(1) Proactive re-optimization, where the optimizer 
chooses query plans with the expectation of re- 
optimization; and (2) Plan logging, where op- 
timizer decisions under different conditions are 
logged over time, enabling plan reuse as well as 
analysis of relevant statistics and benefits of adap- 
tivity.",,,2005-01-01,2005,1,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4

1493,92,"Proactive Re-optimization","Traditional query optimizers rely on the accuracy of estimated
statistics to choose good execution plans. This design often leads to
suboptimal plan choices for complex queries, since errors in
estimates for intermediate subexpressions grow exponentially in the
presence of skewed and correlated data distributions. Reoptimization
is a promising technique to cope with such mistakes.
Current re-optimizers first use a traditional optimizer to pick a
plan, and then react to estimation errors and resulting
suboptimalities detected in the plan during execution. The
effectiveness of this approach is limited because traditional
optimizers choose plans unaware of issues affecting reoptimization.
We address this problem using proactive reoptimization,
a new approach that incorporates three techniques:
i) the uncertainty in estimates of statistics is computed in the form of
bounding boxes around these estimates, ii) these bounding boxes are
used to pick plans that are robust to deviations of actual values from
their estimates, and iii) accurate measurements of statistics are
collected quickly and efficiently during query execution. We present
an extensive evaluation of these techniques using a prototype
proactive re-optimizer named Rio. In our experiments Rio
outperforms current re-optimizers by up to a factor of three.",,,2005-06-13,2005,1,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4
1839,92,"Progressive Parametric Query Optimization","Commercial applications usually rely on pre-compiled parameterized procedures to interact with a database. Unfortunately, executing a procedure with a set of parameters different from those used at compilation time may be arbitrarily sub-optimal. Parametric query optimization (PQO) attempts to solve this problem by exhaustively determining the optimal plans at each point of the parameter space at compile time. However, PQO is likely not cost-effective if the query is executed infrequently or if it is executed with values only within a subset of the parameter space. In this paper we propose instead to progressively explore the parameter space and build a parametric plan during several executions of the same query. We introduce algorithms that, as parametric plans are populated, are able to frequently bypass the optimizer but still execute optimal or near-optimal plans.",Databases,"Databases, Query Optimization, Parametric Query Optimization",2009-04-01,2009,3,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4

1841,92,"A Framework for Performance Evaluation of Complex Event Processing Systems (poster)","Several new Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines have been recently released, many of which are intended to be used in performance sensitive scenarios - like fraud detection, traffic control, or health care systems. However, there is no standard means to assess the performance of a CEP engine. This omission is all the more relevant as there are currently many competing products, languages, architectures, data models, and data processing CEP techniques. A performance evaluation framework can help identify good design decisions and assist in improving engines. Here we demonstrate our work in progress: FINCoS, a framework that can be used to benchmark CEP systems. The proposed framework has five relevant characteristics: 
i.	Flexible (e.g., it allows changing the workload on the fly to measure reactions to peak loads);
ii.	Independent of particular workloads;
iii.	Neutral (not bound to any specific CEP product); 
iv.	Correctness check (validators can be plugged into the framework on demand to verify results);
v.	Scalable (many of its components, like event generators, can be centrally orchestrated and run in parallel).

Note that the framework does not include a benchmark specification. In fact, it was designed such that diverse datasets and query scenarios can be easily attached and tested on several CEP engines.

As such, this framework has three key benefits: first, it can be used by the CEP community to more quickly devise and experiment new benchmarks for event processing systems. Second, CEP vendors can employ the framework in conjunction with their own test datasets to benchmark their systems internally. Finally, customers can use it with their real data and select the CEP engine that best fits their needs.",,,2008-07-01,2008,1,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4

Nonetheless, the time a task will take to complete is often unknown beforehand.

2673,92,"Flood: Elastic Streaming MapReduce","Distributed data stream processing (DSP) is used to analyze information and raise alarms in business-critical scenarios such as financial fraud-detection, clickstream processing, network security, traffic control, or real-time KPI computations. Processing this information efficiently is very challenging because the nature of continuous streaming sources is varying in nature: often the amount of data and processing changes with time of day and day of week and frequently has unexpected spikes. Thus, the result is that most DSP computations are either over-provisioned, introducing increased cost and wasted energy, or are under- provisioned and, either incur in performance degradation or denial-of-service, or have to resort to load shedding.
We demonstrate Flood, a scalable, elastic DSP engine that solves these problems. By using a scalable computing model, MapReduce, and adequately monitoring running computations our system is able to decide, in runtime, if there is a lack or a waste of resources. Flood then acts autonomically by requesting or releasing computing nodes, immediately expanding or contracting the computation, making sure that latency and throughput requirements are guaranteed. This leads to augmented efficiency and lowered costs, all while insuring quality of service.","Distributed Systems","Distributed Stream Processing, Elastic, Scalability",2010-07-01,2010,1,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4

Most of those applications need to compute hundreds or thousands of metrics continuously while coping with very high event input rates. As a consequence, large amounts of state (i.e., moving windows) need to be maintained, very often exceeding the available memory resources. Nonetheless, current event processing platforms have little or no memory management capabilities, hanging or simply crashing when memory is exhausted. In this paper we report our experience in using secondary storage for solving the performance problems of memory-constrained event processing applications. For that, we propose SlideM, a novel buffer management algorithm that exploits the access pattern of sliding windows in order to efficiently handle memory shortages. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a real stream processing engine and validated through an extensive experimental performance evaluation. Results corroborate the efficacy of the approach: the system was able to sustain very high input rates (up to 300,000 events per second) for very large windows (about 30GB) while consuming small amounts of main memory (few kilobytes).","Performance of Event Processing Systems","Disk, Event Stream Processing, Memory Management, Query Plan Sharing, Sliding Window",2013-04-24,2013,1,U,"Pedro Bizarro",bizarro@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/92_pedro_blue_shades.jpg,1974-04-01,bizarro,4

The proposed approach is based on approximate query answering techniques that make it possible to deliver an approximate answer to the user even when one or more computers in the cluster are not available. The evaluation presented in the paper shows both analytically and experimentally that the approximate results obtained this way have a very small error that can be negligible in most of the cases.","Data Warehousing","Data warehousing, distributed query optimization, data partitioning, performance optimization,",2002-09-01,2002,3,U,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

This information is updated periodically from transactional systems. Traditional DW systems have static structures of their data schemas and relationships, and therefore are not prepared to support the dynamics of real-time live data processing. As the concept of real time enterprise evolves, the synchronism between transactional data and DW, statically implemented, has been reviewed. For these purposes, Real-Time Data Warehouses (RTDW) seem to be very promising. This paper presents methodological indications for implementing RTDW, in which transactional data sources are available through common standard database access, allowing to minimize the time needed to accomplish extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) processes of that data, as well as its loading into the DW. The main method presented consists on using structural replicas of all fact tables without primary keys or index files, adapting those replica’s data structures for housing, in real-time, all insert, edit and delete operations (data transactions) that occur within operational systems databases. This is accomplished using only append record operations towards those fact table replicas, allowing to minimize processing time, record locking and concurrency data access problems, both in transactional systems and the DW. Concurrently, this allows maintaining DW availability and keeping OLAP tools functioning properly, providing the most recent business data.","Data Warehousing","Real-Time Data Warehousing, ETL",2004-11-09,2004,1,N,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

In critical care patients, hypotension (HT) may cause serious heart, endocrine or neurological disorders, inducing severe or even lethal events. Moreover, recent studies report an increase of mortality in HT prone hemodialysis patients in need of critical care. If HT could be predicted in advance, medical staff could take action to minimize its effects, or even avoid its occurrence. Typically, most medical systems have focused on monitoring and detecting current patient status, rather than determining biosignal trends or predicting a patient’s future status. Therefore, predicting HT episodes in advance remains a challenge. Furthermore, since critical care actions such as hemodialysis are oftenly inconvenient and uncomfortable procedures, HT prediction or detection methods should be non-invasive, whenever possible. In this paper, we present a solution for continuous monitorization and prediction of HT episodes, using heart rate (HR) and mean blood pressure (BP) non-invasive measured biosignals. We propose an architecture for a HT Predictor (HTP) Tool, presenting a set of tools and a real-time database capable of continuously storing and real-time monitoring all patient’s historical HR and BP biosignal data, and efficiently alerting both probable and detected occurrences of HT episodes for each patient for the following 60 minutes.

Our Query Cache Tool takes advantage of previously executed queries, storing their results and the current state of the data which was accessed. Future queries only need to execute against the new data, inserted since the queries were last executed, and join these results with the previous ones. This makes query execution much faster, because we only need to process the most recent data.

Since they store the secrets of the business, securing their data is critical. To accomplish this, several Database Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) have been proposed. However, when using DIDS in DWs, most solutions either produce too many false positives (i.e. false alarms) that must be verified or too many false negatives (i.e. true intrusions that pass undetected). Moreover, many approaches detect intrusions a posteriori which, given the sensitivity of DW data, may result in irreparable cost. To the best of our knowledge, no DIDS specifically tailored for DWs has been proposed. This pa-per examines intrusion detection from a data warehousing perspective and the reasons why traditional database security methods are not sufficient to avoid in-trusions.

The experimental evaluation using the TPC-H benchmark and a real-world sales DW with Oracle 11g and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 shows that SES-DW achieves better response time in both inserting and querying, than standard and state-of-the-art encryption algorithms such as AES, 3DES, OPES and Salsa20, while providing considerable security strength.","Encryption, Data Security, Data Warehousing","Encryption, Data Security, Data Warehousing",2013-04-25,2013,1,Y,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

3465,97,"Open Business Intelligence for Better Decision-Making","Decision-making is a crucial, yet challenging task in enterprise management. In many organizations, decisions are still made based on experience and intuition rather than on facts and rigorous approaches. This is often due to lack of data, unknown relationships between data and goals, conflicting goals and poorly understood risks. The success of organizations depends on fast and well-founded decisions taken by relevant people in their specific area of responsibility. Business Intelligence (BI) is a collection of decision support technologies
for enterprises aimed at enabling knowledge workers such as executives, managers, and analysts to make better and faster decisions. In this paper, the authors review the concept of BI as an open innovation strategy and address the importance of BI in revolutionizing knowledge towards economics and business sustainability.
The main objective is to discuss why the concept of BI has become increasingly important and presents some of the top key applications and technologies to implement open BI in organizations, which would like to enter into the new market and operate on a global scale.","Business Intelligence","Business Intelligence, Decision-Making, Online Analytical Processing, Open Business Intelligence Systems, Open Source",0000-00-00,2013,3,N,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

Consequently, GA courses are becoming increasingly common in universities. The laboratorial classes of such courses are crucial for students to consolidate and apply the concepts learned in theoretical classes. However, it is required a lot of programming effort and sometimes students tend to have difficulties on this part, either because the number of different GA variants they have to implement or even because the lack of programming skills. To overcome this problem we present a new educational tool for GAs called GraphEA. This tool aims to help students to learn GAs without the need of programming effort, offering novel features like the 3D visualization of the chromosome formation process and the online modification of problem data. In this paper we demonstrate three well-known optimization problems implemented on the tool, namely the Knapsack Problem, the Traveling Salesman Problem, and the Function Optimization Problem.",,"Genetic algorithms, educational and visualization tools, evolutionary computation",0000-00-00,2013,1,N,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

This means that securing them from data damage and information leakage is critical. In order to deal with intrusions against database systems, Database Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) are frequently used. This paper presents a survey on the main database intrusion detection techniques currently available and discusses the issues concerning their application at the database server layer. The identified weak spots show that most DIDS inadequately deal with many characteristics of specific database systems, such as ad hoc workloads and alert management issues in data warehousing environments, for example. Based on this analysis, research challenges are presented, and requirements and guidelines for the design of new or improved DIDS are proposed. The main finding is that the development and benchmarking of specifically tailored DIDS for the context in which they operate is a relevant issue and remains a challenge.

However, execution of requests can become a lengthy and inefficient process for some large databases. Moreover, storing large amounts of data requires servers with larger capacities and scalability capabilities. Relational databases have limitations to deal with scalability for large volumes of data. On the other hand, non-relational database technologies, also known as NoSQL, were developed to better meet the needs of key-value storage of large amounts of records. But there is a large amount of NoSQL candidates, and most have not been compared thoroughly yet. The purpose of this paper is to compare different NoSQL databases, to evaluate their performance according to the typical use for storing and retrieving data. We tested 10 NoSQL databases with Yahoo!

4040,97,"DBMS Application Layer Intrusion Detection for Data Warehouses","Data Warehouses (DWs) are used for producing business knowledge and aiding decision support. Since they store the secrets of the business, securing their data is critical. To accomplish this, several Database Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) have been proposed. However, when using DIDS in DWs, most solutions produce either too many false-positives (i.e., false alarms) that must be verified or too many false-negatives (i.e., true intrusions that pass undetected). Moreover, many approaches detect intrusions a posteriori which, given the sensitivity of DW data, may result in irreparable cost. To the best of our knowledge, no DIDS specifically tailored for DWs has been proposed. This paper examines intrusion detection from a data warehousing perspective and the reasons why traditional database security methods are not sufficient to avoid intrusions. We define the specific requirements for a DW DIDS and propose a conceptual approach for a real-time DIDS for DWs at the SQL command level that works transparently as an extension of the Database Management System &#40;DBMS&#41; between the user applications and the database server itself. A preliminary experimental evaluation using the TPC-H decision support benchmark is included to demonstrate the DIDS’ efficiency.",,,0000-00-00,2013,5,Y,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

Cassandra has been pinpointed as one of the most efficient and scalable among currently existing NoSQL engines. Scalability of these engines means that, by adding nodes, we could have more served requests with the same performance and more nodes could result in reduced execution time of requests. However, we will see that adding nodes not always results in performance increase and we investigate how the workload, database size and the level of concurrency are related to the achieved scaling level. We will overview Cassandra data store engine, and then we evaluate experimentally how it behaves concerning scaling and request time speedup. We use the YCSB – Yahoo!

With the increased interest of researchers and companies in non-relational technology, NoSQL databases became widely used and a common belief emerged defending that those engines scale well. This means that the use of more nodes would result in reduced execution time of requests and the system would scale adequately, by adding nodes proportionally to data size and load. However, sometimes, adding nodes may not result in improvement of request-serving time. Therefore, it is useful to investigate how different factors, such as workload, data size and number of simultaneous sessions influence scaling capabilities.

The quality of the data, i.e., the degree to which the data characteristics fulfill requirements, can have a tremendous impact on the businesses themselves, the companies, or even in human lives. In fact, research and industry reports show that huge amounts of capital are spent to improve the quality of the data being used in many systems, sometimes even only to understand the quality of the information in use. Considering the variety of dimensions, characteristics, business views, or simply the specificities of the systems being evaluated, understanding how to measure quality can be an extremely difficult task. In this paper we survey the state of the art in classification of poor data, including the definition of dimensions and specific data problems, we identify frequently used dimensions and map data quality problems to the identified dimensions. The huge variety of terms and definitions found suggests that further standardization efforts are required; also, data quality research on Big Data appears to be in its initial steps, leaving open space for further research.","data quality classification","Poor data quality, dirty data, poor data classification, data quality problems",2015-11-28,2015,1,N,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

Cloud computing leverages Big Data by providing high storage and processing capabilities and enables corporations to consume resources in a pay-as-you-go model making clouds the optimal environment for storing and processing huge quantities of data. By using virtualized resources, Cloud can scale very easily, be highly available and provide massive storage capacity and processing power. This paper surveys existing databases models to store and process Big Data within a Cloud environment. Particularly, we detail the following traditional NoSQL databases: BigTable, Cassandra, DynamoDB, HBase, Hypertable, and MongoDB. The MapReduce framework and its developments Apache Spark, HaLoop, Twister, and other alternatives such as Apache Giraph, GraphLab, Pregel and MapD - a novel platform that uses GPU processing to accelerate Big Data processing - are also analyzed. Finally, we present two case studies that demonstrate the successful use of Big Data within Cloud environments and the challenges that must be addressed in the future.

BI is a broad category of applications and technologies for gathering, storing, analyzing, and providing access data to help enterprise users make better business decisions. Whereas in the past the Business Intelligence market was strictly dominated by closed source and commercial tools, the last few years were characterized by the birth of open source BI solutions.

4498,97,"A Predictive Model for Exception Handling","The exception handling mechanism has been one of the most used reliability tools in programming languages for over four decades. Nearly all modern languages have some form of “try-catch” model for exception handling and encourage its use. Nevertheless, this model has not seen significant change, even in the face of new challenges, such as concurrent programming and the advent of reactive programming. As it stands, the current model is reactive, rather than proactive — exceptions are raised, caught, and handled. We propose an alternative exception handling model — PreX — where exceptions are no longer caught but, rather, predicted and prevented. Online Failure Prediction techniques generally work at a very high level, showing potential for pre- diction of program crashes. However, these techniques have never been at the hands of the programmers as an effective tool to improve software quality. By applying recent advances in Online Failure Prediction, PreX aims to fully prevent exceptions, bringing failure prediction techniques to a much more fine-grained level that the programmer can control. Pre- dicting exceptions enables a range of preventive measures that enhance the reliability and robustness of a system, offering new revitalization strategies to developers.","Exception Handling",,0000-00-00,2016,1,N,"Jorge Bernardino",jorge@isec.pt,1450816154_JB_foto.png,1964-03-06,jb,4

Besides the problem of roundoff error in floating point arithmetic, we identify two further weakpoints, namely lack of protection of data during input and output, and incorrect execution of the correctness checks. We propose the Robust ABFT technique to handle those weakpoints. We then generalize it to programs that use assertions, where similar problems arise, leading to the technique of Robust Assertions, whose effectiveness is shown by fault injection experiments on a realistic control application. With this technique a system follows a new failure model, that we call Fail-Bounded, where with high probability all results produced are either correct or, if wrong, they are within a certain bound of the correct value, whose exact value depends on the output assertions used. We claim that this failure model is very useful to describe the behavior of many low redundancy systems.","Failure Models","Failure models, assertions, ABFTs, error detection methods, fault injection.",1998-06-23,1998,1,U,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4
429,124,"Can Software Implemented Fault-Injection be used on Real-Time Systems?","Software Implemented Fault Injection (SWIFI) is a well-established technique for fault injection, but with a significant drawback for Real-Time Systems: intrusiveness, also known as 'probe effectâ?. In fact, for most fault models, additional code has to be run on the same processor that executes the application. The danger lies in some deadlines being missed as a consequence of that overhead.
This paper identifies the sources of intrusiveness, and discusses the procedures to measure it. The question of what level of intrusiveness can be considered acceptable is also addressed.
A Pentium version of an existing SWIFI tool (Xception), developed with no real-time considerations in mind, was tested on a system composed by off the shelf (COTS) components (a standard PC with a Pentium processor and a commercial real time multitasking kernel). Data collected using this platform shows that the intrusiveness can be quite significant.
A technique called ""Routine Specialization"" is proposed to lower that overhead. Results obtained from a 'real time orientedâ? injector (RT-Xception) taken from the same system, show a very significant improvement. A comparison with data from other authors shows that with this change SWIFI becomes a viable technique for a wide range of real-time applications.","Software Fault Emulation and Injection","fault-injection, real-time, dependability evaluation",1999-09-15,1999,1,U,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4
435,124,"A Study of Failure Models in Feedback Control Systems","Feedback Control Systems have a peculiar behavior that allows them to compensate for disturbances in the controlled application. This paper investigates whether this resilience also extends to disturbances originating from faults in the controller itself. The question of what kind of failure model is more effective in this type of system is addressed, with three different models being studied: arbitrary failure, fail silent, and fail-bounded.
The study is conducted essentially by experimental fault-injection in the controller of one of the best known and most demanding of the benchmarks used in the control systems area: an inverted pendulum. The considered failure models are compared according to criteria based on the quality of the control action. Other insights gained from the experiments made are described, for instance on how to significantly increase dependability at a very low-cost in feedback controllers, and on the need for a different kind of real-time scheduling algorithms.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","System Fault-Tolerance, Fault-Injection, Real-Time, Failure Models, Feedback Control Systems",2001-06-30,2001,1,U,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4
468,124,"On the Use of Disaster Prediction for Failure-Tolerance in Feedback Control Systems","Feedback control algorithms are inherently designed to compensate for external disturbances that the controlled system may suffer. This resilience is also extensible to late or wrong control actions produced by a failed controller computer, providing a degree of fault tolerance without the use of any particular mechanism. However, some controller failures, due to their duration or value, may indeed collapse the system, and thus other recovery measures must be taken.
This paper proposes the inclusion of an Oracle that calculates, in a timely manner, the controlled system behavior under a failed controller, and triggers recovery when the control algorithm is predictably no more able to compensate for a particular controller failure. The systems so built follow the Fail-Bounded model. The main contribution of this paper is to show how this model can be implemented in a practical way for the very important class of applications based on feedback control, thus turning that model into a technique that can be used effectively to build production systems.
The method was validated experimentally through fault injection on the controller computer of an inverted pendulum, one of the most time-demanding control system benchmarks.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","Feedback control system, real-time, failure-tolerance, disaster prediction, evaluation",2002-06-23,2002,1,U,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4
469,124,"Reset-Driven Fault Tolerance","A common approach in embedded systems to achieve fault-tolerance is to reboot the computer whenever some non-permanent error is detected. All the system code and data are recreated from scratch, and a previously established checkpoint, hopefully not corrupted, is used to restart the application data. The confidence is thus restored on the activity of the computer.
The idea explored in this paper is that of unconditionally resetting the computer in each control frame (the classic read sensors -> calculate control action -> update actuators cycle). A stable-storage based in RAM is used to preserve the system's state between consecutive cleanups and a standard watchdog timer guarantees that a reset is forced whenever an error crashes the system.
We have evaluated this approach by using fault-injection in the controller of a standard temperature control system. The experimental observations show that the Reset-Driven Fault Tolerance is a very simple yet effective technique to improve reliability at an extremely low cost since it is a conceptually simple, software only solution with the advantage of being application independent.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","reset-driven fault tolerance, fault removal, dependability, embedded real-time systems",2002-10-23,2002,1,U,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4

validation and presents the architecture of a pin-level fault injector called RIFLE. This system can be adapted to a wide range of target systems and the faults are mainly injected in the processor pins. The injection of the faults is deterministic and can be reproduced if needed. Faults of different nature can be injected and the fault injector is able to detect whether the injected fault has produced an error or not without the requirement of feedback circuits. RIFLE can also detect specific circumstances in which the injected faults do not affect the target system. Sets of faults with specific impact on the target system can be generated. The paper also presents fault injection results showing the coverage and latency achieved with a set of simple behavior based error detection mechanisms. It is shown that up to 72,5% of the errors can be detected with fairly simple mechanisms. Furthermore, for over 90% of the faults the target system has behaved according to the fail-silent model, which suggests that a traditional computer equipped
with simple error detection mechanisms is relatively close to a fail-silent computer.","Fault Injection","Pin-level Fault Injection",1994-10-01,1994,1,U,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4

The main purpose of LMC Paradigm is to explain, using a very simple Model, the main components of a real computer system, and to learn how to program using a simple decimal-encoded instruction set. Using new LMC Simulators (based on LMC Paradigm) developed since then, students can nowadays take advantages from simulation processes (e.g., to simulate a program step-by-step execution). We evaluated six different LMC simulators, picked the 'best practicesâ? associated to each one and developed a new simulator, especially focused on Management and Informatics undergraduate students requirements.

The most powerful FPGAs are based in SRAM technology which is particularly prone to transient faults. Fault-tolerance is therefore mandatory and this can be done by simply reprogramming the FPGA, thus repairing the corrupted configuration. Recent advances in FPGA technology allow the configuration of just a portion of the FPGA, which lowers significantly the time overhead, while the remaining parts are running. This truly dynamic partial FPGA reconfiguration can be used to provide fault-tolerance for hard real-time applications, guaranteeing high reliability in long missions. This short paper addresses the technological aspects of partial dynamic reconfigurable FPGAs, presents some of most important threats to dependability of these devices, and identifies some research areas to investigate in order to increase dependability.","FPGA reconfiguration","FPGA, reconfiguration, dependability",2011-05-11,2011,1,Y,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4

Our aim is to complement the state-of-the art by proposing a new approach for understanding and characterizing the maintainability of OO systems, which makes use of test data and of the information gathered from the tests' execution.","Software Engineering","Complexity theory,Correlation,Measurement,Ontologies,Software;Standards,Testing,Software Maintenance,Software Quality,Software Testing",2014-09-26,2014,1,Y,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4

Once software complexity is one of the most important attributes to determine software maintainability, controlling its level in the system evolution process makes the software easier to maintain, reducing the maintainability costs. Otherwise, uncontrolled complexity makes the maintenance and enhancement process lengthy, more costly and some times it can contribute to the system abandonment. This work investigates the evolution of complexity in discontinued FLOSS projects. After several analyses, the results showed that inactive FLOSS projects do not seem to be able to keep up with the extra work required to control the systems complexity, presenting a different behaviour of the successful active FLOSS projects.","Software Engineering","Software Architecture Software Evolution Complexity Software Failure, Software Engineering",2014-10-29,2014,1,Y,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4

However, the susceptibility of such memory cells to Single Event Upsets (SEU) requires the use of fault tolerant designs, for which fault injection is still the most accepted verification technique. This paper describes FIRED, a fault injector targeted at SRAM-based FPGAs for dependability evaluation of critical systems. This tool is able to perform hardware fault injection in real-time, by inserting bitflips at the SRAM cells through partial dynamic reconfiguration. These faults may produce errors in the design of the VHDL or Verilog modules deployed in the FPGA. A case study of a fault injection campaign in a PID-based cruise control system is used to evaluate the capabilities of FIRED, namely its capacity of injecting faults while a physical application is being controlled.

4601,124,"Improving Self-Adaptation Planning through Software Architecture-based Stochastic Modeling","The ever-growing complexity of software systems makes it increasingly challenging to foresee at design time all interactions between a system and its environment.

Most self-adaptive systems trigger adaptations through operators that are statically configured for specific environment and system conditions. However, in the occurrence of uncertain conditions, self-adaptive decisions may not be effective and might lead to a disruption of the desired non-functional attributes.

To address this, we propose an approach that improves the planning stage by predicting the outcome of each strategy. In detail, we automatically derive a stochastic model from a formal architecture description of the managed system with the changes imposed by each strategy. Such information is used to optimize the self-adaptation decisions to fulfill the desired quality goals.

To assess the effectiveness of our approach we apply it to a cloud-based news system and predicted the reliability for each possible adaptation strategy. The results obtained from our approach are compared to a representative static planning algorithm as well as to an oracle that always makes the ideal decision. Experiments show that our method improves both availability and cost when compared to the static planning algorithm, while being close to the oracle.

Our approach may therefore be used to optimize self-adaptation planning.",,,2016-01-28,2016,3,Y,"Mário Alberto Zenha Rela",mzrela@dei.uc.pt,1418379092_mzr.png,1962-12-02,mzrela,4

Among hybrid models, the most important include digital controllers and hybrid integrators. The HFSS ability to provide a common ground to represent all these elements permits to model complex systems in a simple framework. We present a detailed model of a PID controller and we show how this digital controller can be merged with other types of components.

3601,188,"Aspect-oriented programming and pluggable software units: A comparison based on design patterns","The support for software reuse has been a major goal in the design of programming languages. This goal, however, has proven difficult to reach, being only partially enabled by current software tools. In particular, reuse is not fully supported by object-oriented programming (OOP). Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has introduced new operators that extend OOP, enabling a superior support for reusability. However, AOP operators exhibit limitations in supporting software reuse and more powerful constructs are still required. We consider the ability to define software in an independent manner as the key construct to enable systematic software reuse. To bridge the gap between independence and practical software tools, we have developed the concept of Independent and Pluggable Software Unit (PU), a construct that supports the definition of software topologies. In this paper, we compare PUs with AOP in their support for reusable software. To enable comparison, we employ some well described problems addressed by Software Design Patterns (SDPs). We provide PU and AOP versions of several SDPs, including, Observer, Composite, Command, Chain of Responsibility, and Proxy. In particular, we show that, whereas PUs provide a unified representation of design patterns, AOP representations do not achieve this unification. We also show that AOP solutions do not promote independent and reusable software.","Software Enginnering","Pluggable Software Units, Reuse, Aspect Programming, Design Patterns, DOI: 10.1002/spe.2224",2013-09-03,2013,3,N,"Fernando Barros",barros@dei.uc.pt,,1975-01-01,barros,4

When the network fails, developers must rollback the application to some coherent state on their own using error-prone solutions. Overcoming this limitation is, therefore, a deeply investigated and challenging problem. Existing solutions range from transport-layer to application-layer protocols, including additions to TCP, usually transparent to the application. None of these solutions is perfect for the task, because they all impact TCP's simplicity, performance or ubiquity, if not all.

To avoid these shortcomings, we contain TCP connection crashes inside a single session layer exposed as a sockets interface. Based on this interface, we create a blocking and a non-blocking fault-tolerant design pattern. We explore the blocking design in an open source File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and perform a thorough evaluation of performance, complexity and overhead of both designs. Our results show that using one of the patterns to tolerate TCP connection crashes, in new or existing applications, involves a very limited effort and negligible penalties.","Fault-Tolerance in Distributed Systems","TCP, Connection Failure, Fault-Tolerance, Session Layer, Design Pattern",2014-12-16,2014,1,Y,"Fernando Barros",barros@dei.uc.pt,,1975-01-01,barros,4

313,194,"Providing Applications With Mobile Agent Technology","Over the last couple of years we have been working on the development of mobile agents systems and its application to the areas of telecommunications and network management. This work path produced positive results: a competitive mobile agent platform was built, the run-time benefits of mobile agents were proved, and our industrial partners have developed practical applications that are being integrated into commercial products. However, despite the positive results, we feel that mobile agent technology is still not ready to enter the path of mainstream software development. In our perspective, one of the main reasons for this situation arises from the traditional approach to mobile agent technology. This approach, based on the familiar concept of the mobile-agent distributed platform as an extension of the operating system, focuses too much on the mobile agents and associated issues (mobility, agent lifecycle, security, coordination, etc.) and provides poor support for the development of applications where mobile agents are just one of several available technologies. Learning from past experience, we are now working on a new approach where the focus is brought back to the applications and mobile agents become just one the tools available to develop distributed systems. This provides a much lighter framework for application-based mobile agent systems. This paper presents the lessons learned from our previous project and discusses the new concept we are developing: application-centric mobile agent systems.","Mobile Agents",,2001-04-27,2001,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

Hosts must be protected from malicious agents, agents must be protected from other agents and also agents must be protected from malicious hosts. For solving the first three problems, existing technology from operating systems and distributed systems research can be used. The last problem is new and specific to the mobile agent paradigm and it is much harder to solve. Due to this problem, many say that mobile agents are not ready for the e commerce systems. In this paper we discuss the security requirements of mobile agents in the context of electronic commerce and analyze how these requirements can be met. We show that, because of the characteristics of e commerce systems, the security requirements of the agents and their users can be assured in real and open environments as the Internet.","Mobile Agents",,1999-10-01,1999,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

Although these platforms normally have a very interesting set of features, one common limitation found on most architectures is the lack of support for extensibility, i.e. the ability to add new features at runtime, after the platform has been written and deployed. This is an important question since it limits the usability of the platforms across application domains, and its future usefulness as software requirements change. In this paper, we present a general mechanism for platform extensibility based on binary software components. The mechanism was implemented using the JavaBeans component model and several services where implemented and deployed. The approach undertaken is generic and can be easily adapted into existing mobile agent platforms.","Mobile Agents",,2000-12-01,2000,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

For being able to deploy such a model into real world applications, security is a vital concern. In the M&M project we have developed a system that departures from the traditional platform-based execution model for mobile agents. In M&M there are no agent platforms. Instead there is a component framework that allows the applications to become able of sending and receiving agents by themselves in a straightforward manner. In this paper we examine the security mechanisms available in M&M, and how integration with existing applications is done. One difficult aspect of this work is that all the features must work with the security mechanisms that already exist on the applications. This is so because the components are integrated from within into the applications, which already have security mechanisms in place. Currently, M&M provides features like fine-grain security permissions, encryption of agents and data, certificate distribution using LDAP and cryptographic primitives for agents.

They are autonomous, have a strong sense of location and are able to operate independently of a central server. Nevertheless, although this is true, for developing a mobile agent system that is capable of operating in a disconnected computing environment, much more is needed: persistence stores where the agents can be safely stored; agent reactivation mechanisms, which allow agents to migrate when a network connection is detected; policies and notification mechanisms for dealing with changing locations; among other things. In this paper, we present the mechanisms developed for the M&M mobile agent framework in order to address mobile and disconnected computing environments. These mechanisms can be readily adapted to any other platform that needs to deal with disconnected computing.","Mobile Agents",,2002-11-01,2002,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4
367,194,"Component-based Development of Mobile Agent Systems","A mobile agent is a simple, natural and logical extension of the remote distributed object concept. It is an object with an active thread of execution that is capable of migrating between applications. By using mobile agents, the programmer is no longer confined to have static objects and perform remote invocations, but can program the objects to move directly between applications. In itself, a mobile agent is just a programming abstraction: an active object that can move when needed. It is a structuring primitive, similar to the notion of class, remote object or thread. 

The central argument of this thesis is that although the mobile agent concept is just a structuring primitive, the current mainstream middleware implementations do not convey it simply as such. In fact, they force all the development to be centered on mobile agents, provide poor integration with existing programming environments, do not integrate well with other middleware, and force the developers to depart from current object-oriented techniques. The objective of this work was to demonstrate that it is possible to create an infrastructure such that the mobile agent concept can be leveraged into existing object-oriented languages in a simple and transparent way, without interfering in the manner in which the applications are normally structured. 

In order to achieve this goal, a component-oriented framework was devised and implemented, allowing programmers to use mobile agents as needed. Applications can still be developed using current object-oriented techniques but, by including certain components, they gain the ability to send, receive and interact with agents. The component palette was implemented using the JavaBeans technology and given the name M&M. Furthermore it was integrated with ActiveX, allowing programmers from any programming language that supports COM/ActiveX to take advantage of this paradigm. 
To validate the soundness of the approach, a large number of applications have been implemented using M&M. Two application domains were of particular interest: agent-enabling web servers and disconnected computing. The M&M component framework allows any web server that supports the Servlet Specification to send, receive and use mobile agents. M&M provides a clean integration, requiring neither a custom-made web server nor a special purpose agent platform. Finally, supporting disconnected computing has allowed us to understand the current limitations of the framework in supporting very low-level operations.","Mobile Agents",,2003-07-01,2003,6,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

1308,194,"Making Exception Handling Work","Most modern programming languages rely on exceptions for dealing with errors. Although exception handling was a significant improvement over other mechanisms like checking return codes, it's far from perfect. In fact, it can be argued that this mechanism is seriously flawed. In this paper we argue that exception handling should be automatically done at the runtime/operating system level. The motivation is similar to the one that lead to garbage collection: memory management was a tedious and error prone process, thus virtual machines included support for taking care of it. We believe that many exceptions can be automatically dealt with, and recovered, as long as appropriate mechanisms exist in the runtime environment. We believe that this approach may dramatically influence the way programming languages are designed and significantly contribute to having more robust code, being  actually developed with much less programming effort.","Exception handling mechanisms",,2006-11-08,2006,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

1335,194,"DGSchedSim: a trace-driven simulator to evaluate scheduling algorithms for desktop grid environments","This paper describes DGSchedSim, a trace driven simulator to evaluate scheduling algorithms focused on minimising turnaround time of applications executed in heterogeneous desktop grid systems. The simulator can be used to model task farming applications comprised of a set of independent and equal sized tasks similarly to numerous @Home public computing projects like the popular SETI@Home. DGSchedSim permits to assess scheduling policies under several scenarios allowing to control parameters such as the application's requirements (number of tasks, individual requirements of tasks like needed CPU time), the properties of the environment (machines computing capabilities and availabilities) and the characteristics of the execution (frequency and storage location of checkpoints, etc.). The simulations are driven by traces collected from real desktop grid systems.

Besides DGSchedSim, the paper presents the Cluster Ideal Execution Time (CIET) algorithm that computes the ideal wall-clock time required by a fully dedicated and totally reliable cluster of M heterogeneous machines to process the T tasks of an application.
As a test to the simulator capabilities, the paper analyses the suitability of two scheduling algorithms, FCFS and MinMax, for delivering fast turnaround time in desktop grids. Both algorithms, when combined with a centrally stored checkpoint policy, achieve efficiency close to 50% of CIET for certain scenarios.","Desktop Grid","desktop grid, simulator, checkpointing",2006-02-14,2006,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4
1495,194,"Component Agent Systems: Building a Mobile Agent Architecture That You Can Reuse","One central problem preventing widespread adoption of mobile agents as a code structuring primitive is that current mainstream middleware implementations do not convey it simply as such. In fact, they force all the development to be centered on mobile agents, which has serious consequences in terms of software structuring and, in fact, technology adoption. This chapter discusses the main limitations of the traditional platform-based approach, proposing an alternative: component-based mobile agent systems. Two case studies are discussed: the JAMES platform, a traditional mobile agent platform specially tailored for network management; and M&M, a component-based system for agent-enabling applications. Finally, a bird's eye perspective on the last 15 years of mobile agent systems research is presented along with an outlook on the future of the technology.

Although exception handling was a significant improvement over other mechanisms like checking return codes, it is far from perfect. In fact, it can be argued that this mechanism is seriously limited, if not, flawed. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion by providing
quantitative measures on how programmers are currently using exception handling. We examined 32 different applications, both for Java and .NET. The major conclusion for this work is that exceptions are not being correctly used as an error recovery mechanism. Exception handlers are not specialized enough for allowing recovery and, typically, programmers just do one of the following actions: logging, user notification and application termination. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study done on exception handling to date, providing a quantitative measure useful for guiding the development of new error handling mechanisms.","Exception handling mechanisms",,2007-07-30,2007,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

1771,194,"A Case for Automatic Exception Handling","Exception handling mechanisms have been around for more than 30 years. Nevertheless, modern exceptions systems are not very different from the early
models. Programming languages designers often neglect the exception mechanism and look at it more like an add-on for their language instead of central part. As a consequence, software quality suffers as programmers feel that the task of writing good error handling code is too complex, unattractive and inefficient. We propose a new model that automates the handling of exceptions by the runtime platform. This
model frees the programmer from having to write exception handling code and, at the same time, successfully increases the resilience of programs to abnormal situations.","Exception handling mechanisms",,2008-09-15,2008,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4
1841,194,"A Framework for Performance Evaluation of Complex Event Processing Systems (poster)","Several new Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines have been recently released, many of which are intended to be used in performance sensitive scenarios - like fraud detection, traffic control, or health care systems. However, there is no standard means to assess the performance of a CEP engine. This omission is all the more relevant as there are currently many competing products, languages, architectures, data models, and data processing CEP techniques. A performance evaluation framework can help identify good design decisions and assist in improving engines. Here we demonstrate our work in progress: FINCoS, a framework that can be used to benchmark CEP systems. The proposed framework has five relevant characteristics: 
i.	Flexible (e.g., it allows changing the workload on the fly to measure reactions to peak loads);
ii.	Independent of particular workloads;
iii.	Neutral (not bound to any specific CEP product); 
iv.	Correctness check (validators can be plugged into the framework on demand to verify results);
v.	Scalable (many of its components, like event generators, can be centrally orchestrated and run in parallel).

Note that the framework does not include a benchmark specification. In fact, it was designed such that diverse datasets and query scenarios can be easily attached and tested on several CEP engines.

As such, this framework has three key benefits: first, it can be used by the CEP community to more quickly devise and experiment new benchmarks for event processing systems. Second, CEP vendors can employ the framework in conjunction with their own test datasets to benchmark their systems internally. Finally, customers can use it with their real data and select the CEP engine that best fits their needs.",,,2008-07-01,2008,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

2147,194,"Concurrency by Default: Using Permissions to Express Dataflow in Stateful Programs","The rise of the multicore era is catapulting concurrency into mainstream programming. Current programming paradigms build in sequentiality, and as a result, concurrency support in those languages forces programmers into low-level reasoning about execution order. In this paper, we introduce a new programming paradigm in which concurrency is the default. Our ÿMINIUM language uses access permissions to express logical dependencies in the code at a higher level of abstraction than sequential order. Therefore compiler/runtime-system can leverage that dependency information to allow concurrent execution. Because in ÿMINIUM programmers specify dependencies rather than control flow, there is no need to engage in difficult, error-prone, and low-level reasoning about execution order or thread interleavings. Developers can instead focus on the design of the program, and benefit as the runtime automatically extracts the concurrency inherent in their design.","Concurrent Programming",,2009-10-01,2009,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4
2148,194,"Implementing Retry ' featuring AOP","Everyday experience tells us that some errors are transient, but also that some can be handled simply by 'retryingâ? the failed operation. For instance, a glitch on the network might turn a resource unreachable for a short period of time; or a sudden peak of work on a server can cause a momentary denial of service. In many occasions, without other kind of specialized recovery code, it is possible to keep a program running only by retrying a failed operation. Unfortunately, retry is not explicitly available on many platforms or programming languages and, even if it were, it could not be blindly used for dealing with every abnormal situation. On languages like C# or Java, or even on languages that offer the retry construct such as Smalltalk and Eiffel, where errors are represented and communicated through exceptions, there is no simple way to clear the effects of a failed operation and, thus, re-attempt its execution. Programmers have to explicitly write sometimes complex and error-prone code to repair the state of a program and the execution context. In this paper, we propose an AOP technique for implementing 'retryâ? on systems lacking such a feature without using any language extensions for AOP or imposing modifications to the development language. Our approach eliminates the need for programmers to write \""state-cleaning\"" code for normal objects by means of a transparent transactional mechanism and provides the means to identify non-idempotent operations on the code. In our evaluation we show that a relevant number of application failures can be masked using this approach.","Exception handling mechanisms",,2009-09-01,2009,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

We also perform some experiments to assess engines scalability with respect to number of que-ries and propose ways for evaluating their ability in adapting to changes in load conditions.

2671,194,"Deadline Queries: Using Elastic MapReduce to Produce On-Time Results","MapReduce has become a widely used tool for computing complex tasks that process massive amounts of data in large clusters. These tasks commonly execute on a fraction of the nodes of a larger cluster, and it is left to users to make best guesses on the number of nodes needed for a task to complete within acceptable time. Nonetheless, the time a task will take to complete is often unknown beforehand. Previous research addressed this problem by establishing time constraints for query execution and, when needed, reduce the accuracy of queries using result approximation and/or sampling. However in many situations reduced accuracy is not tolerable. In this paper we present FloodDQ, a MapReduce system that implements deadline queries?queries that must finish before a deadline, never discarding data or reducing accuracy. FloodDQ produces timely, accurate results by adaptively increasing or decreasing computing power, at runtime, towards completing execution within the specified deadline. In FloodDQ, users only specify a deadline and the input data. The system monitors the progress of the task and extrapolates whether it will complete on time. If the task is deemed to complete after the specified time, the system requests more nodes from an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider, and adds them to the computation. On the other hand, if the task is deemed to complete before the specified time the system quiesces and releases surplus nodes, cutting costs to a minimum.

2673,194,"Flood: Elastic Streaming MapReduce","Distributed data stream processing (DSP) is used to analyze information and raise alarms in business-critical scenarios such as financial fraud-detection, clickstream processing, network security, traffic control, or real-time KPI computations. Processing this information efficiently is very challenging because the nature of continuous streaming sources is varying in nature: often the amount of data and processing changes with time of day and day of week and frequently has unexpected spikes. Thus, the result is that most DSP computations are either over-provisioned, introducing increased cost and wasted energy, or are under- provisioned and, either incur in performance degradation or denial-of-service, or have to resort to load shedding.
We demonstrate Flood, a scalable, elastic DSP engine that solves these problems. By using a scalable computing model, MapReduce, and adequately monitoring running computations our system is able to decide, in runtime, if there is a lack or a waste of resources. Flood then acts autonomically by requesting or releasing computing nodes, immediately expanding or contracting the computation, making sure that latency and throughput requirements are guaranteed. This leads to augmented efficiency and lowered costs, all while insuring quality of service.","Distributed Systems","Distributed Stream Processing, Elastic, Scalability",2010-07-01,2010,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

Most of those applications need to compute hundreds or thousands of metrics continuously while coping with very high event input rates. As a consequence, large amounts of state (i.e., moving windows) need to be maintained, very often exceeding the available memory resources. Nonetheless, current event processing platforms have little or no memory management capabilities, hanging or simply crashing when memory is exhausted. In this paper we report our experience in using secondary storage for solving the performance problems of memory-constrained event processing applications. For that, we propose SlideM, a novel buffer management algorithm that exploits the access pattern of sliding windows in order to efficiently handle memory shortages. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a real stream processing engine and validated through an extensive experimental performance evaluation. Results corroborate the efficacy of the approach: the system was able to sustain very high input rates (up to 300,000 events per second) for very large windows (about 30GB) while consuming small amounts of main memory (few kilobytes).","Performance of Event Processing Systems","Disk, Event Stream Processing, Memory Management, Query Plan Sharing, Sliding Window",2013-04-24,2013,1,U,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4

In this paper we present the ÆMINIUM concurrent-by-default programming language. Using ÆMINIUM programmers express data dependencies rather than control flow between instructions. Dependencies are expressed using permissions, which are used by the type system to automatically parallelize the application. The ÆMINIUM approach provides a modular and composable mechanism for writing concurrent applications, preventing data races in a provable way. This allows programmers to shift their attention from low-level, error-prone reasoning about thread interleaving and synchronization to focus on the core functionality of their applications. We study the semantics of ÆMINIUM through ?ÆMINIUM, a sound core calculus that leverages permission flow to enable concurrent-by-default execution.

One of the challenging aspects of this type of system is how to deal with exceptional situations, since it is very difficult to assert the precise state of a concurrent program when an exception arises.

Its main quality attributes are simplicity and expressiveness, allowing programmers to deal with exceptional situations in a concurrent setting in a familiar way. The proposal is centered on a new kind of exception type that defines new paths for exception propagation among concurrent threads of execution. In our model, beyond being able to control where exceptions are raised, the developer can define in which thread, and when during its execution, a particular exception will be handled. The proposed model has been implemented in Scala, and we show its application to the construction of concurrent software.","Exception Handling",,2015-11-21,2015,1,N,"Paulo Marques",pmarques@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/194_IMG_4361.jpg,1975-07-12,pmarques,4
154,201,"Fault-Detection by Result-Checking for the Eigenproblem","This paper proposes a new fault detection mechanism for the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the so called eigenproblem, for which no such scheme existed before, to the best of our knowledge. It consists of a number of assertions that can be executed on the results of the computation to determine their correctness. The proposed scheme follows the Result Checking principle, since it does not depend on the particular numerical algorithm used. It can handle both real and complex matrices, symmetric or not. Many practical issues are handled, like rounding errors and eigenvalue ordering, and a practical implementation was built on top of unmodified routines of the well-known LAPACK library. The proposed scheme is simultaneously very efficient, with less than 2% performance overhead for medium to large matrices, very effective, since it exhibited a fault coverage greater than 99.7% with a confidence level of 99%, when subjected to extensive fault-injection experiments, and very easy to adapt to other libraries of mathematical routines besides LAPACK.","Result Checking","Result Checking, Fault Injection, Assertions, Eigenproblem,",1999-09-15,1999,1,U,"Paula Prata",pprata@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/201_,1975-01-01,pprata,4

For the latter extensive error injection experiments were made. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that RC is validated by fault injection.

160,201,"Practical Issues in the Use of ABFT and a new Failure Model","In this paper we study the behavior of Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) techniques under faults injected according to a quite general fault model. Besides the problem of roundoff error in floating point arithmetic, we identify two further weakpoints, namely lack of protection of data during input and output, and incorrect execution of the correctness checks. We propose the Robust ABFT technique to handle those weakpoints. We then generalize it to programs that use assertions, where similar problems arise, leading to the technique of Robust Assertions, whose effectiveness is shown by fault injection experiments on a realistic control application. With this technique a system follows a new failure model, that we call Fail-Bounded, where with high probability all results produced are either correct or, if wrong, they are within a certain bound of the correct value, whose exact value depends on the output assertions used. We claim that this failure model is very useful to describe the behavior of many low redundancy systems.","Failure Models","Failure models, assertions, ABFTs, error detection methods, fault injection.",1998-06-23,1998,1,U,"Paula Prata",pprata@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/201_,1975-01-01,pprata,4
691,201,"High Coverage Assertions","Assertions based on the knowledge of the application can be very effective at detecting corruption of critical data or design faults that transparent techniques are unable to deal with. Particularly, high coverage assertions are very promising because of their 
low-overhead and high error coverage.
This thesis starts by characterizing the behavior of assertions-based error detection mechanisms under faults injected according to a quite general fault model. The main problems are identified as being the lack of protection of data outside the section covered by assertions, namely during input and output, and the possible incorrect execution of the assertions. 
To handle those weak-points the Robust Assertions technique is proposed, whose effectiveness is shown by extensive fault injection experiments on a realistic control application. With this technique a system follows a new failure model, that is called 
Fail-Bounded, where with high probability all results produced are either correct or, if wrong, they are within a certain bound of the correct value, whose exact distance depends on the output assertions used. 
We claim that this failure model is very useful to describe the behavior of many systems with low hardware and software redundancy.

Any kind of assertions can be considered, from simple likelihood tests to high coverage assertions such as those used in the two paradigms investigated in this thesis, Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) and Result-Checking (RC). 
ABFT is the collective name of a set of techniques used to determine the correctness of some mathematical calculations. The basic idea is to apply some encoding to the input data of the calculation, execute the algorithm on the encoded data, and check that the encoding is preserved at the end. A less well known alternative is called Result Checking (RC) where, contrary to ABFT, results are checked without knowledge of the particular algorithm used to calculate them. These two error detection methods based on high coverage assertions assure a nearly complete error coverage for most of the matrix operations that are the basis of all scientific computation. 
A comparative study between ABFT and RC shows that RC is a good alternative to ABFT for detecting errors due to physical or design faults. Being the first time that RC is evaluated by fault injection, it is shown that although both methods exhibit equivalent error coverage, RC has lower overhead and has the important advantage of being independent of the underlying algorithm.
To substantiate the practical value of RC, we have developed a result checker for a problem for which no such checker existed: the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the so-called eigenproblem. The proposed fault detection mechanism based on the new RC, implemented on top of routines from the LAPACK library using the Robust Assertions structure, is simultaneously very efficient and very effective. It has less than 2% performance overhead for medium to large matrices and it exhibited an error coverage greater than 99.7% with a confidence level of 99%, when subjected to extensive 
fault-injection experiments.
We conclude that high coverage assertions can be used to build highly reliable 
low-overhead systems.","Error Detection","Error detection, Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT),  robust assertions, Result-Checking (RC), fault injection, fail-bounded",2000-09-20,2000,6,U,"Paula Prata",pprata@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/201_,1975-01-01,pprata,4

422,202,"Low-Cost Fault Tolerance for Continuous Real-Time Control Systems","Traditionally related to industrial control, continuous real-time control systems are spread throughout every area of our technology driven society. One of the most popular ways to achieve the correct functioning of those systems is through redundancy, by replicating some parts of the controller hardware and comparing their results. However, the high cost demanded by this approach is normally only acceptable in mission-critic or human-critic systems. A major percentage of control systems is limited to ad hoc solutions for fault tolerance based on empirical observations.
An important characteristic shared by the generality of continuous real-time control systems is the ability to tolerate some external disturbances affecting the controlled process, such as the air temperature, wind or dust. However, when the controller itself is subject to faults and produces some wrong or late control actions, it has been observed that, some times, there is no need to use any redundant system to recover.
The purpose of replication is to guaranty the correct and timely behaviour of the controller. However, continuous real""-time control systems are able to intrinsically tolerate transient controller malfunctions, the same way they can tolerate external disturbances affecting the controlled process. It is thus acceptable that fault tolerance be considered to avoid the collapse of the whole system (i.e., when the system stops delivering the expected 
service or its quality becomes unacceptable), instead of avoiding the controller failure (i.e., when the controller produces wrong or late results).
By allowing a controller to fail, although during a limited amount of time, fault tolerance can be addressed by a new standpoint. It is then possible to trade off spatial by time redundancy, significantly reducing the costs for fault tolerance and thus permitting its use in low-cost control systems.
The studies presented in this thesis, along with some practical solutions and experimental results, prove that it is feasible to provide real-time control systems with high dependability by means of generic software solutions.","Dependability Analysis","fault tolerance, real-time systems, continuous control systems, fault injection, stable storage, fail-bounded model, disaster prevision, reset, dependability, assertions, failure tolerance, experimental evaluation",2003-07-30,2003,6,U,"João Carlos Cunha",jcunha@dei.uc.pt,,1967-01-25,jcunha,4
429,202,"Can Software Implemented Fault-Injection be used on Real-Time Systems?","Software Implemented Fault Injection (SWIFI) is a well-established technique for fault injection, but with a significant drawback for Real-Time Systems: intrusiveness, also known as 'probe effectâ?. In fact, for most fault models, additional code has to be run on the same processor that executes the application. The danger lies in some deadlines being missed as a consequence of that overhead.
This paper identifies the sources of intrusiveness, and discusses the procedures to measure it. The question of what level of intrusiveness can be considered acceptable is also addressed.
A Pentium version of an existing SWIFI tool (Xception), developed with no real-time considerations in mind, was tested on a system composed by off the shelf (COTS) components (a standard PC with a Pentium processor and a commercial real time multitasking kernel). Data collected using this platform shows that the intrusiveness can be quite significant.
A technique called ""Routine Specialization"" is proposed to lower that overhead. Results obtained from a 'real time orientedâ? injector (RT-Xception) taken from the same system, show a very significant improvement. A comparison with data from other authors shows that with this change SWIFI becomes a viable technique for a wide range of real-time applications.","Software Fault Emulation and Injection","fault-injection, real-time, dependability evaluation",1999-09-15,1999,1,U,"João Carlos Cunha",jcunha@dei.uc.pt,,1967-01-25,jcunha,4

It is a key element for fault tolerant systems to perform checkpointing and rollback-recovery. It is usually implemented using hard disks, because of its non-volatile characteristics and robustness against processor faults. However, for many control systems, the low speed and unpredictability of disks are not acceptable due to real-time constraints or, specially on embedded systems, disks are simply not available. In such cases, main memory should be used.
In this paper we present and test a stable storage mechanism relying exclusively on local main memory, and able to survive processor malfunctions. We show that by a careful use of some very common features of processors, like memory protection, we can obtain very high data survivability to system crashes. The study was conducted on COTS computers and a commercial real-time executive running two sample applications, which were subjected to intensive fault injection campaigns.

435,202,"A Study of Failure Models in Feedback Control Systems","Feedback Control Systems have a peculiar behavior that allows them to compensate for disturbances in the controlled application. This paper investigates whether this resilience also extends to disturbances originating from faults in the controller itself. The question of what kind of failure model is more effective in this type of system is addressed, with three different models being studied: arbitrary failure, fail silent, and fail-bounded.
The study is conducted essentially by experimental fault-injection in the controller of one of the best known and most demanding of the benchmarks used in the control systems area: an inverted pendulum. The considered failure models are compared according to criteria based on the quality of the control action. Other insights gained from the experiments made are described, for instance on how to significantly increase dependability at a very low-cost in feedback controllers, and on the need for a different kind of real-time scheduling algorithms.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","System Fault-Tolerance, Fault-Injection, Real-Time, Failure Models, Feedback Control Systems",2001-06-30,2001,1,U,"João Carlos Cunha",jcunha@dei.uc.pt,,1967-01-25,jcunha,4
468,202,"On the Use of Disaster Prediction for Failure-Tolerance in Feedback Control Systems","Feedback control algorithms are inherently designed to compensate for external disturbances that the controlled system may suffer. This resilience is also extensible to late or wrong control actions produced by a failed controller computer, providing a degree of fault tolerance without the use of any particular mechanism. However, some controller failures, due to their duration or value, may indeed collapse the system, and thus other recovery measures must be taken.
This paper proposes the inclusion of an Oracle that calculates, in a timely manner, the controlled system behavior under a failed controller, and triggers recovery when the control algorithm is predictably no more able to compensate for a particular controller failure. The systems so built follow the Fail-Bounded model. The main contribution of this paper is to show how this model can be implemented in a practical way for the very important class of applications based on feedback control, thus turning that model into a technique that can be used effectively to build production systems.
The method was validated experimentally through fault injection on the controller computer of an inverted pendulum, one of the most time-demanding control system benchmarks.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","Feedback control system, real-time, failure-tolerance, disaster prediction, evaluation",2002-06-23,2002,1,U,"João Carlos Cunha",jcunha@dei.uc.pt,,1967-01-25,jcunha,4
469,202,"Reset-Driven Fault Tolerance","A common approach in embedded systems to achieve fault-tolerance is to reboot the computer whenever some non-permanent error is detected. All the system code and data are recreated from scratch, and a previously established checkpoint, hopefully not corrupted, is used to restart the application data. The confidence is thus restored on the activity of the computer.
The idea explored in this paper is that of unconditionally resetting the computer in each control frame (the classic read sensors -> calculate control action -> update actuators cycle). A stable-storage based in RAM is used to preserve the system's state between consecutive cleanups and a standard watchdog timer guarantees that a reset is forced whenever an error crashes the system.
We have evaluated this approach by using fault-injection in the controller of a standard temperature control system. The experimental observations show that the Reset-Driven Fault Tolerance is a very simple yet effective technique to improve reliability at an extremely low cost since it is a conceptually simple, software only solution with the advantage of being application independent.","Fault-Tolerance in Control Systems","reset-driven fault tolerance, fault removal, dependability, embedded real-time systems",2002-10-23,2002,1,U,"João Carlos Cunha",jcunha@dei.uc.pt,,1967-01-25,jcunha,4

The most powerful FPGAs are based in SRAM technology which is particularly prone to transient faults. Fault-tolerance is therefore mandatory and this can be done by simply reprogramming the FPGA, thus repairing the corrupted configuration. Recent advances in FPGA technology allow the configuration of just a portion of the FPGA, which lowers significantly the time overhead, while the remaining parts are running. This truly dynamic partial FPGA reconfiguration can be used to provide fault-tolerance for hard real-time applications, guaranteeing high reliability in long missions. This short paper addresses the technological aspects of partial dynamic reconfigurable FPGAs, presents some of most important threats to dependability of these devices, and identifies some research areas to investigate in order to increase dependability.","FPGA reconfiguration","FPGA, reconfiguration, dependability",2011-05-11,2011,1,Y,"João Carlos Cunha",jcunha@dei.uc.pt,,1967-01-25,jcunha,4

However, the susceptibility of such memory cells to Single Event Upsets (SEU) requires the use of fault tolerant designs, for which fault injection is still the most accepted verification technique. This paper describes FIRED, a fault injector targeted at SRAM-based FPGAs for dependability evaluation of critical systems. This tool is able to perform hardware fault injection in real-time, by inserting bitflips at the SRAM cells through partial dynamic reconfiguration.

4375,202,"Studying the Propagation of Failures in SOAs","Although Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) are being increasingly used in business-critical scenarios, the applicability of Verification and Validation (V&V) is still very limited. The problem is that V&V activities have to be implemented at runtime to fit the characteristics of SOA. Recent proposals of runtime V&V techniques specific to SOA domain are far from being complete and a key issue lies in understanding how the “failures propagate” in a dynamic system and how to continuously verify its evolving elements. This paper introduces
an approach to deal with the propagation of failures in a SOA environment. The proposed technique is based on three key steps: estimating the failure rate of the individual services, using fault injection to find the exposure of each service to failures from the invoked services, and estimating the impact of each service in the overall architecture. The overall approach is presented with a brief demonstration of its application.","Propagation of Failures in Service Oriented Architectures","failure propagation, fault injection, FMEA, Runtime V&V, SOA",2015-06-22,2015,1,Y,"João Carlos Cunha",jcunha@dei.uc.pt,,1967-01-25,jcunha,4

DGSchedSim permits to assess scheduling policies under several scenarios allowing to control parameters such as the application's requirements (number of tasks, individual requirements of tasks like needed CPU time), the properties of the environment (machines computing capabilities and availabilities) and the characteristics of the execution (frequency and storage location of checkpoints, etc.).

The rationale behind our approach is to permit checkpoint reuse, so that when a computation is forced to move from one node to another, it can be restarted from an intermediary point provided by the last saved checkpoint.
We study the effects of sharing checkpoints in application turnaround time simulating three scheduling algorithms based on First Come First Served: FCFS, FCFS AT and FCFS TR. The targeted environment consists of institutional desktop grids.

Currently, BOINC workers store their checkpoints locally. A major limitation 
of this approach is that whenever a worker leaves un&#64257;nished computation, no 
other worker can proceed from the last stable checkpoint. This forces tasks to be 
restarted from scratch when the original machine is no longer available.

where nodes share all the checkpoints they compute. Cliques function as sur- 
vivable units, where checkpoints and tasks are not lost as long as one of the 
nodes of the clique remains alive. To simplify construction and maintenance of

Desktop grids are software infrastructures that aim to exploit the otherwise idle processing power, making it available to users that require computational resources to solve long-running applications. The outcome of some efforts to harness idle machines can be seen in public projects such as SETI@home and Folding@home that boost impressive performance figures, in the order of several hundreds of TFLOPS each. At the same time, many institutions, both academic and corporate, run their own desktop grid platforms. However, while desktop grids provide free computing power, they need to face important issues like fault tolerance and security, two of the main problems that harden the widespread use of desktop grid computing. In this thesis, we aim to exploit a set of fault tolerance techniques, such as checkpointing and redundant executions, to promote faster turnaround times. We start with an experimental study, where we analyze the availability of the computing resources of an academic institution. We then focus on the benefits of sharing checkpoints in both institutional and wide-scale environments. We also explore hybrid schemes, where the traditional centralized desktop grid organization is complemented with peer-to-peer resources. Another major issue regarding desktop grids is related with the level of trust that can be achieved relatively to the volunteered hosts that carry out the executions. We propose and explore several mechanisms aimed at reducing the waste of computational resources needed to detect incorrect computations. For this purpose, we detail a checkpoint-based scheme for early detection of errors. We also propose and analyze an invitation-based strategy coupled to a credit rewarding scheme, to allow the enrollment and filtering of more trustworthy and more motivated resource donors. To summarize, we propose and study several fault tolerance methodologies oriented toward a more efficient usage of resources, resorting to techniques such as checkpointing, replication and sabotage tolerance to fasten and to make more reliable executions that are carried over desktop grid resources. The usage of techniques like these ones will be of ultimate importance for the wider deployment of applications over desktop grids.","Desktop Grid","Desktop grid, fault tolerance, dependability, BOINC, volunteer computing, checkpoint, scheduling",2009-05-11,2009,6,U,"Patricio Domingues",patricio@dei.uc.pt,207_,1975-01-01,patricio,4

BOINC clients request computing jobs to a central server and run them alongside other regular applications. Unfortunately, this kind of execution causes two kinds of problems. Firstly, developers must port their application to every single operating system target, which usually means maintaining several different versions of the same application. Secondly, any application running natively on desktop grid hardware is a potential security threat to the volunteer client.\\
During the course of this research we sought an efficient and generic method for alternative execution of jobs in BOINC clients. Our approach is strongly guided by the principles of non-intrusiveness and contains two main components. The first is a library, libboincexec, which is able to control several virtual machines monitors. The second is a modified BOINC wrapper that provides the glue between libboincexec and the middleware.\\
Through the use of this solution we are able to effectively use virtual machines to perform computation on desktop grids. This computation is inherently safe because virtual machines provide sandboxing. Additionally, by targeting the same virtual operating system, the problem of maintaining different versions of an application does not exist, thereby solving the heterogeneity problem of desktop grid nodes.","Grid Computing","boinc; desktop grids; virtualization; sandboxing;",2011-05-20,2011,1,Y,"Patricio Domingues",patricio@dei.uc.pt,207_,1975-01-01,patricio,4

In such environments, threats exist for both the donated resources and the submitters. On one hand volunteers need protection against code that inadvertently or maliciously might harm their resources. Indeed, a volunteer project disrupting the regular working of the volunteer machines would have serious public relation consequences seriously hindering the public perception of volunteer computing. On the other hand, the behavior and results produced by volunteers need to be properly scrutinized to detect inappropriate actions and/or erroneous results, and thus ensure the dependability of the performed computations.
Therefore, security and dependability are two major goals that need to be carefully considered for a successful desktop grid experience. However, as we shall see in this chapter, security and dependability are complex issues, with many desktop grid frameworks addressing both issues in a less than perfect way. Thus, the volunteering of resources and submission of tasks still require a fairly amount of implicit trust between donors and harvesters.

2812,210,"Using Partial Dynamic FPGA Reconfiguration to Support Real-Time Dependability","Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), are being increasingly used in custom systems requiring fast time-to-market delivery due to their flexibility; being reprogrammable in the field is a real value for long unattended operation and whenever on- site maintenance is costly as is the case in many remote data acquisition stations. The most powerful FPGAs are based in SRAM technology which is particularly prone to transient faults. Fault-tolerance is therefore mandatory and this can be done by simply reprogramming the FPGA, thus repairing the corrupted configuration. Recent advances in FPGA technology allow the configuration of just a portion of the FPGA, which lowers significantly the time overhead, while the remaining parts are running. This truly dynamic partial FPGA reconfiguration can be used to provide fault-tolerance for hard real-time applications, guaranteeing high reliability in long missions. This short paper addresses the technological aspects of partial dynamic reconfigurable FPGAs, presents some of most important threats to dependability of these devices, and identifies some research areas to investigate in order to increase dependability.","FPGA reconfiguration","FPGA, reconfiguration, dependability",2011-05-11,2011,1,Y,"Raul Barbosa",rbarbosa@dei.uc.pt,210_photo_371x280.jpg,1981-12-31,rbarbosa,4
3129,210,"TRONE: Trustworthy and Resilient Operations in a Network Environment","Cloud infrastructures play an increasingly important role for telecom operators, because they enable internal consolidation of resources with the corresponding savings in hardware and management costs. However, this same consolidation exposes core services of the infrastructure to very disruptive attacks. This is indeed the case with monitoring, which needs to be dependable and secure to ensure proper operation of large datacenters and cloud infrastructures. We argue that currently existing centralized monitoring approaches (e.g., relying on a single solution provider, using single point of failure components) represent a huge risk, because a single vulnerability may compromise the entire monitoring infrastructure.

In this paper, we describe the TRONE approach to trustworthy monitoring, which relies on multiple components to achieve increased levels of reliance on the monitoring data and hence increased trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the TRONE framework for event dissemination, on security-oriented diagnosis based on collected events and on fast network adaptation in critical situations based on multi-homing application support.

To validate our work, we will deploy and demonstrate our solutions in a live environment provided by Portugal Telecom.

3136,210,"A Middleware for Exactly-Once Semantics in Request-Response Interactions","Although the need for the exactly-once request-response interaction
pattern is ubiquitous in distributed systems, making it work in practice
is anything but simple. Ensuring the at-most-once part of the invocation
is relatively easy. Unfortunately, the same is not true for the at-least-once
guarantee, which depends on the recovery from crashes of the client, the server
and the network. This is what
makes the exactly-once interaction so difficult in practice: client
and server must log their actions into stable storage, and they must
be able to restart the network connections. 

In this paper, we present a middleware that implements the exactly-once request-response pattern, in presence of network and endpoints
crashes. The main contribution of our work is to release the programmer from the complex tasks of recovering from message losses and network crashes.

3137,210,"Replication for Dependability on Virtualized Cloud Environments","Execution of critical services traditionally requires multiple distinct replicas, supported by independent network and hardware. To operate properly, these services often depend on the correctness of a fraction of replicas, usually over $2/3$ or $1/2$. Defying the ideal situation, economical reasons may tempt users to replicate critical services onto a single multi-tenant cloud infrastructure. Since this may expose users to correlated failures, we assess the risks for two kinds of majorities: a conventional one, related to the number of replicas, regardless of the machines where they run; and a second one, related to the physical machines where the replicas run. This latter case may exist in multi-tenant virtualized environments only. We evaluate crash-stop and Byzantine faults that may affect virtual machines or physical machines. Contrary to what one might expect, we conclude that replicas do not need to be evenly distributed by a fixed number of physical machines. On the contrary, we found cases where they should be as unbalanced as possible. We try to systematically identify the best defense for each kind of fault and majority to conserve.

However, such achievements require significant computational power, and there is no solid knowledge on which adaptation phases experience the higher consumption of resources.

Finally, we present a performance comparison between different approaches including the one with our improvements and show the actual financial costs of deploying such systems in a mainstream cloud computing service (AWS).

4074,210,"CloudBFT: Elastic Byzantine Fault Tolerance","Cloud computing is increasingly important, with the industry moving towards outsourcing computational resources as a means to reduce investment and management costs, while improving security, dependability and performance. Cloud operators use multi-tenancy, by grouping virtual machines (VMs) into a few physical machines (PMs), to pool computing resources, thus offering elasticity to clients. Although cloud-based fault tolerance schemes impose communication and synchronization overheads, the cloud offers excellent facilities for critical applications, as it can host varying numbers of replicas in independent resources. Given these contradictory forces, determining whether the cloud can host elastic critical services is a major research question. We address this challenge from the perspective of a standard three-tiered system with relational data.  We propose to tolerate Byzantine faults using groups of replicas placed on distinct physical machines, as a means to avoid exposing applications to correlated failures. To improve the scalability of our system, we divide data to enable parallel accesses. Using a realistic setup, this setting can reach speedups largely exceeding the number of partitions. Even for a wide variation of the load, the system preserves latency and throughput within reasonable bounds. We believe that the elasticity we observe demonstrates the feasibility of tolerating Byzantine faults in a cloud-based server using a relational database.

To fulfill the goals of the project, we propose very standard technologies and procedures: a three-tiered architecture; a separation of the online and analysis databases; and an Enterprise Service Bus to get the input from very diverse hardware and software stacks. In this paper we discuss several options regarding the location of these facilities on the cloud and we also evaluate the costs involved.

Most self-adaptive systems trigger adaptations through operators that are statically configured for specific environment and system conditions. However, in the occurrence of uncertain conditions, self-adaptive decisions may not be effective and might lead to a disruption of the desired non-functional attributes.

To address this, we propose an approach that improves the planning stage by predicting the outcome of each strategy. In detail, we automatically derive a stochastic model from a formal architecture description of the managed system with the changes imposed by each strategy. Such information is used to optimize the self-adaptation decisions to fulfill the desired quality goals.

To assess the effectiveness of our approach we apply it to a cloud-based news system and predicted the reliability for each possible adaptation strategy. The results obtained from our approach are compared to a representative static planning algorithm as well as to an oracle that always makes the ideal decision. Experiments show that our method improves both availability and cost when compared to the static planning algorithm, while being close to the oracle.

Our approach may therefore be used to optimize self-adaptation planning.",,,2016-01-28,2016,3,Y,"Raul Barbosa",rbarbosa@dei.uc.pt,210_photo_371x280.jpg,1981-12-31,rbarbosa,4

313,227,"Providing Applications With Mobile Agent Technology","Over the last couple of years we have been working on the development of mobile agents systems and its application to the areas of telecommunications and network management. This work path produced positive results: a competitive mobile agent platform was built, the run-time benefits of mobile agents were proved, and our industrial partners have developed practical applications that are being integrated into commercial products. However, despite the positive results, we feel that mobile agent technology is still not ready to enter the path of mainstream software development. In our perspective, one of the main reasons for this situation arises from the traditional approach to mobile agent technology. This approach, based on the familiar concept of the mobile-agent distributed platform as an extension of the operating system, focuses too much on the mobile agents and associated issues (mobility, agent lifecycle, security, coordination, etc.) and provides poor support for the development of applications where mobile agents are just one of several available technologies. Learning from past experience, we are now working on a new approach where the focus is brought back to the applications and mobile agents become just one the tools available to develop distributed systems. This provides a much lighter framework for application-based mobile agent systems. This paper presents the lessons learned from our previous project and discusses the new concept we are developing: application-centric mobile agent systems.","Mobile Agents",,2001-04-27,2001,1,U,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4
314,227,"Mobile Agent Infrastructures: a Solution for Management or a Problem to Manage?","Mobile Agent Technology (MAT) is a fresh paradigm for distributed programming, with potential for application in a broad range of fields. A Mobile Agent (MA) corresponds to a small program that is able to migrate to some remote machine, where it is able to execute some function or collect some relevant data and then migrate to other machines in order to accomplish another task. The basic idea of this
paradigm is to distribute the processing throughout the network: that is, send the code to the data instead of bringing the data to the code. MA systems differ from other mobile code and agent-based technologies because increased code and state mobility allow for even more flexible and dynamic solutions.
In the last couple of years we have developed the JAMES platform for mobile agents [5], which was later used by our industrial partners to produce and deploy several MA-based applications for telecommunications and network management. These circumstances provided us with a good perspective on infrastructure manageability and lead to the development of several services for better administration of the JAMES platform.

However, legacy applications and architectures impose considerable inertia to the deployment of new solutions for network management. For this reason, successful MA infrastructures will need flexible and effortless integration with legacy management frameworks, like the widespread SNMP architecture.
This paper presents a set of solutions for the integration of SNMP into MA platforms, to support access to SNMP management resources and to introduce MA-based management services that can be reachable from legacy SNMP-capable applications.

Hosts must be protected from malicious agents, agents must be protected from other agents and also agents must be protected from malicious hosts. For solving the first three problems, existing technology from operating systems and distributed systems research can be used. The last problem is new and specific to the mobile agent paradigm and it is much harder to solve. Due to this problem, many say that mobile agents are not ready for the e commerce systems. In this paper we discuss the security requirements of mobile agents in the context of electronic commerce and analyze how these requirements can be met.

Although these platforms normally have a very interesting set of features, one common limitation found on most architectures is the lack of support for extensibility, i.e. the ability to add new features at runtime, after the platform has been written and deployed. This is an important question since it limits the usability of the platforms across application domains, and its future usefulness as software requirements change. In this paper, we present a general mechanism for platform extensibility based on binary software components.

For being able to deploy such a model into real world applications, security is a vital concern. In the M&M project we have developed a system that departures from the traditional platform-based execution model for mobile agents. In M&M there are no agent platforms. Instead there is a component framework that allows the applications to become able of sending and receiving agents by themselves in a straightforward manner. In this paper we examine the security mechanisms available in M&M, and how integration with existing applications is done. One difficult aspect of this work is that all the features must work with the security mechanisms that already exist on the applications. This is so because the components are integrated from within into the applications, which already have security mechanisms in place. Currently, M&M provides features like fine-grain security permissions, encryption of agents and data, certificate distribution using LDAP and cryptographic primitives for agents.

974,227,"A Java Interface for WMPI","MPI and PVM have been widely accepted for parallel programming and several implementations have been reported for clusters of UNIX workstations, supercomputers and parallel machines. In the recent past there has been an increasing use of MPI and PVM in clusters of personal computers running the Windows operating system. Traditionally, parallel programs have been developed in Fortran and C. However, the extraordinary success of the Java language has raised an impressive hype among the community of software programmers, in such a way that it seems quite promising that parallel programmers could also use Java in their applications. This can be assured if the communication libraries (PVM and MPI) could also provide a Java interface, thereby complementing the existing C and Fortran programming interfaces.
In this paper, we describe the implementation of Java interface for WMPI, a Windows-based implementations of MPI that have been developed and supported by our group. We show some details about the implementation, a MPI programming example using Java and we present some experimental results that compare the performance of Java WMPI, Java WPVM and the C programs counterparts.","Parallel and Distributed Computing",,1998-09-07,1998,1,U,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

976,227,"How to Get Volunteers for Web-based Computing","Web-based parallel computing is a promising idea provided there are a considerable number of Internet users that would volunteer their CPU cycles for a global computation. The execution time of Web-based parallel applications is thus unpredictable and quite dependent of the good willing of other users. We have developed a project, called JET, and we found this is an important problem that needs to be solved. Some features should then be provided by the system to seize and maintain the enthusiasm of users that contribute the CPU idle cycles of their machines. A possible solution is to provide a Web-page with statistics about the
contribution time and computational power offered by each individual user or institution.
In this paper, we present the design of JET-STATS, a server of statistics that was developed in our project. The server was implemented inside a HTTP daemon and several optimization techniques have been used for the sake of efficiency. It provides the statistical information in a Web page that provides a flexible and fancy interface. This server was implemented in a modular way and it can be easily adapted to any other system that uses the idea of Web-based parallel computing.","Parallel and Distributed Computing",,1998-06-22,1998,1,U,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

In this paper we quantify the usage of main resources (CPU, main memory, disk space and network bandwidth) of
Windows 2000 machines from classroom laboratories. For that purpose, 169 machines of 11 classroom laboratories were monitored over 77 consecutive days. Samples were collected from all machines every 15 minutes for a total of 583653 samples.
Besides evaluating availability of machines (uptime and downtime) and usage habits of users, the paper assesses usage of main resources, focusing on the impact of interactive login sessions over resource consumptions. Also, resorting to Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) parameters of hard disks, the study estimates the average uptime per hard drive power cycle for the whole life of monitored computers.
Our results show that resources idleness in classroom computers is very high, with an average CPU idleness of 97.9%, unused memory averaging 42.1% and unused disk space of the order of gigabytes per machine.

The simulator can be used to model task farming applications comprised of a set of independent and equal sized tasks similarly to numerous @Home public computing projects like the popular SETI@Home. DGSchedSim permits to assess scheduling policies under several scenarios allowing to control parameters such as the application's requirements (number of tasks, individual requirements of tasks like needed CPU time), the properties of the environment (machines computing capabilities and availabilities) and the characteristics of the execution (frequency and storage location of checkpoints, etc.). The simulations are driven by traces collected from real desktop grid systems.

Besides DGSchedSim, the paper presents the Cluster Ideal Execution Time (CIET) algorithm that computes the ideal wall-clock time required by a fully dedicated and totally reliable cluster of M heterogeneous machines to process the T tasks of an application.
As a test to the simulator capabilities, the paper analyses the suitability of two scheduling algorithms, FCFS and MinMax, for delivering fast turnaround time in desktop grids.

In fact, volatility of desktop grid nodes reduces the efficiency of such environments when a fast turnaround time is sought, since a task might get stalled if its assigned machine remains unavailable for a somewhat long period of time (long at the scale of the computation). The rationale behind our approach is to permit checkpoint reuse, so that when a computation is forced to move from one node to another, it can be restarted from an intermediary point provided by the last saved checkpoint.
We study the effects of sharing checkpoints in application turnaround time simulating three scheduling algorithms based on First Come First Served: FCFS, FCFS AT and FCFS TR. The targeted environment consists of institutional desktop grids. 

Our results show that sharing checkpoints is particularly effective in volatile environments, yielding performance improvement up to three times relatively to schemes based on private checkpoints.

1686,227,"Using cliques of nodes to store desktop grid checkpoints","Checkpoints that store intermediate results of computation have a fundamental 
impact on the computing throughput of Desktop Grid systems, like BOINC. 
Currently, BOINC workers store their checkpoints locally. A major limitation 
of this approach is that whenever a worker leaves un&#64257;nished computation, no 
other worker can proceed from the last stable checkpoint. This forces tasks to be 
restarted from scratch when the original machine is no longer available. 

To overcome this limitation, we propose to share checkpoints between nodes. 
To organize this mechanism, we arrange nodes to form complete graphs (cliques), 
where nodes share all the checkpoints they compute. Cliques function as sur- 
vivable units, where checkpoints and tasks are not lost as long as one of the 
nodes of the clique remains alive. To simplify construction and maintenance of 
the cliques, we take advantage of the central supervisor of BOINC. To evaluate 
our solution, we combine simulation with some real data to answer the most 
fundamental question: what do we need to pay for increased throughput?","Desktop Grid",,2008-04-02,2008,1,U,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4
1687,227,"Defeating Colluding Nodes in Desktop Grid Computing Platforms","Desktop Grid systems reached a preeminent place 
among the most powerful computing platforms in the 
planet. Unfortunately, they are extremely vulnerable to mis- 
chief, because volunteers can output bad results, for reasons 
ranging from faulty hardware (like over-clocked CPUs) to 
intentional sabotage. To mitigate this problem, Desktop 
Grid projects replicate work units and apply majority vot- 
ing, typically on 2 or 3 results. 

In this paper, we observe that this form of replication is 
powerless against malicious volunteers that have the inten- 
tion and the (simple) means to ruin the project using some 
form of collusion. We argue that each work unit needs at 
least 3 voters and that voting pools with con&#64258;icts enable the 
master to spot colluding malicious nodes. Hence, we post- 
process the voting pools in two steps: i) we use a statistical 
approach to identify nodes that were not colluding, but sub- 
mitted bad results; ii) we use a rather simple principle to 
go after malicious nodes which acted together: they might 
have won con&#64258;icting voting pools against nodes that were 
not identi&#64257;ed in step i. We use simulation to show that our 
heuristic can be quite effective against colluding nodes, in 
scenarios where honest nodes form a majority.","Desktop Grid",,2008-04-18,2008,1,U,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

Secondly, we measure the impact that a virtual machine running a volunteer @home project worker causes on a host OS. Results show that performance attainable on virtual machines depends simultaneously on the virtual machine software and on the application type, with CPU-bound applications much less impacted than IO-bound ones.

While in a desktop grid, personal computers pull jobs when they are idle, in service grids there is a scheduler that pushes jobs to available resources. The work in EDGeS goes well beyond conceptual solutions to bridge these grids together: it reaches as far as actual implementation, standardization, deployment, application porting and training.

One of the work packages of this project concerns monitoring the overall EDGeS infrastructure. Currently, this infrastructure includes two types of desktop grids, BOINC and XtremWeb, the EGEE service grid, and a couple of bridges to connect them.

2242,227,"Defeating colluding nodes in desktop grid computing platforms","Desktop Grid systems reached a preeminent place among the most powerful computing platforms in the planet. Unfortunately, they are extremely vulnerable to mischief, because computing projects exert no administrative or technical control on volunteers. These can very easily output bad results, due to software or hardware glitches (resulting from over-clocking for instance), to get unfair computational credit, or simply to ruin the project. To mitigate this problem, Desktop Grid servers replicate work units and apply majority voting, typically on 2 or 3 results. 
In this paper, we observe that simple majority voting is powerless against malicious volunteers that collude to attack the project. We argue that to identify this type of attack and to spot colluding nodes, each work unit needs \emph{at least} 3 voters. In addition, we propose to post-process the voting pools in two steps. $i$) In the first step, we use a statistical approach to identify nodes that were not colluding, but submitted bad results; $ii$) then, we use a rather simple principle to go after malicious nodes which acted together: they might have won conflicting voting pools against nodes that were not identified in step $i$. We use simulation to show that our heuristic can be quite effective against colluding nodes, in scenarios where honest nodes form a majority.","Desktop Grid",,2009-12-01,2009,3,U,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4
2361,227,"Detection of Performance Anomalies in Web-based Applications","Performance management and dependability are two of the fundamental issues in business-critical applications. The ability to detect the occurrence of performance failures
and anomalies has raised the attention of researchers in the last years. It is in fact a dif?cult problem, since a visible change in the performance can result from some natural cause (e.g., workload variations, upgrades) or by some internal anomaly or fault that may end up in a performance failure or application crash.

Distinguish between the two scenarios is the goal of  the framework presented in this paper. Our framework is targeted for web-based and component-based  applications.  It  makes use of AOP-based monitoring, data correlation techniques and time-series alignment  algorithms to spot the occurrence of performance anomalies avoiding false alarms due to workload variations. The paper includes some experimental results that show the effectiveness of our techniques under the occurrence of dynamic workloads and some fault-load situations.","Dependability Analysis","Performance Anomaly; Fail-Stutter Model; AOP monitoring; Dependability",2010-07-15,2010,1,Y,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

With the estimated values we conducted a classification with the three previous ML algorithms. From the initial results we observed that combining the estimation of parameters supported by time-series models with ML classification techniques provides some good results on the prediction of performance anomalies. We also observed that there is no single ML algorithm that can be applied effectively to predict the response time for all the web-transactions.","Dependability Evaluation Analysis","self-healing, prediction, estimation, recovery, performance anomalies",2010-11-01,2010,1,Y,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

In our previous work we described a framework for detection of performance anomalies in web-based and component-based applications. It provides low overhead monitoring, correctly distinguishes performance anomalies from common workload variations and also presents initial information for system or application server changes related with an application performance anomaly.

In this paper we present a framework extension devised to offer root-cause failure analysis for a given performance anomaly. The monitoring module enables application profiling and ANOVA analysis is used to verify if a performance anomaly is due to internal changes within the application (e.g., application updates) or to external changes (e.g., remote services changes, system/application server change). The paper includes some experimental results that show the effectiveness of our approach to pinpoint the root-cause for different types of performance anomalies and remarks its potential to avoid a considerable number of service failures.

The lower the MTTR the higher the availability. A significant portion of the MTTR is spent in the detection and localization of the cause of the failure. One possible method that may provide good results in the root-cause analysis of application failures is run-time profiling. The major drawback of run-time profiling is the performance impact.

In this paper we describe two algorithms for selective and adaptive profiling of web-based applications. The algorithms make use of a dynamic profiling interval and are mainly triggered when some of the transactions start presenting some symptoms of performance anomaly. The algorithms were tested under different types of degradation scenarios and compared to static sampling strategies. We observed through experimentation that the pinpoint of performance anomalies, supported by the data collected using the adaptive profiling algorithms, stills timely as with full-profiling while the response time overhead is reduced in almost 60%. When compared to a non-profiled version the response time overhead is less than 1.5%. These results show the viability of using run-time profiling to support quickly detection and pinpointing of performance anomalies and enable timely recovery.","Dependability Analysis","application profiling; monitoring; root-cause analysis; performance anomalies; dependability",2011-08-26,2011,1,Y,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

Due to the real-time characteristic of video-streaming, very low failure detection and recovery delays are required. Proactive recovery in face of performance degradation is a prominent area to explore. Current performance analysis work in video-streaming focuses mostly on capacity planning and session admission through complex workload and resource modeling. These models have limited application when degradation is not explained by client workload (e.g., dynamic resource reallocation, software faults and misconfiguration). We explore server-side monitoring of performance degradations in video-streaming servers, based on statistical analysis of server metrics and client-server interaction messages. Statistical analysis of event logs show that analyzed metrics can be used as symptoms of failures to anticipate them and thus enabling proactive recovery. Exception is server overloading caused by streaming of unpopular videos, which are exposed by metrics when QoS degradation is close to accepted quality thresholds.","Failure Prediction in Streaming Servers","Failure Prediction, Video-Streaming",2011-02-15,2011,1,Y,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4
2781,227,"Separating Performance Anomalies from Workload-explained Failures in Streaming Servers","Video-streaming services are dominating the In- ternet, delivering content for video-on-demand, TV, education and collaborative work. Service parameters addressing quality and continuity of video content have a special importance due to the human sensitiveness to variations on video quality and decades of quality patterns absorbed by traditional TV users. Thus, the performance analysis and repair lifecycle at server and network levels is mandatory to avoid degradation of user experience. At the network level, there are several effective techniques based on temporal and spatial data redundancy, though they deeply depend on healthy servers with enough resources to afford both the client and recovery workloads. Excess of streaming workloads and performance anomalies (i.e., server resources exhaustion not explained by client requests) are typical causes of server performance failures. The former is often caused by memory caching of popular videos, which impacts the number of requests accepted by the server and consequently blurs load admittance mechanisms when the workload changes. The latter is caused by server internal factors independent of client workloads (e.g., memory leaks and maintenance activities). Separating client workload related failures from performance anomalies is mandatory for selection of immediate repair actions, capacity planning and to support fault repair. We evaluated the performance of Naive Bayes and C4.5 Trees algorithms for classification of these failure states using client and server performance metrics. Results shown that it is possible to predict the type of failure with levels of recall and accuracy higher than 90% for workload types with different popularity levels.","Failure Prediction and Diagnosis in Streaming Servers","Failure Prediction, Failure Diagnosis, Video-Streaming",2012-05-13,2012,1,Y,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

We propose a self-healing architecture for streaming servers sustained by a biological metaphor of heart that explores proactive server recovery by anticipating performance failures through detection of arrhythmias (transmission delays of streaming content) and session probing. We evaluated the approach in RTSP streaming through experimental work in several resource exhaustion scenarios.

In this paper we provide an experimental study about the de- tection abilities provided by the monitoring tools that are being used nowadays in web-based applications. Besides the system- level, end-to-end and container-level monitoring techniques we incorporate an application-level monitoring technique. This technique provides the detection of performance anomalies by performing a correlation analysis among application param- eters collected by an aspect-oriented program. The detection latency, the number of end-users affected, the coverage analysis and the overhead achieved by each monitoring technique, was evaluated considering different anomaly scenarios. Despite the importance of the monitoring techniques complementarity, the results achieved by the application-level monitoring are very interesting: it has detected 100% of the anomaly scenarios tested; for 73% of the anomalies it was the fastest detection technique; and due to the low detection latency it contributes to reduce the number of end-users experiencing the anomalies.","Anomaly Detection in Web-based Applications","dependability, fail-stutter, crash- failures, performance anomalies",2012-08-25,2012,1,Y,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

3808,227,"A Framework for Self-Healing and Self-Adaptation of Cloud-Hosted Web-Based Applications","The adaptation of a cloud infrastructure is an ongoing process. Cloud adaptation aims to provide the cloud infrastructure with the necessary computational resources to meet the agreed SLAs and, simultaneously, optimize the resources usage. In a cloud, the consumers are typically limited to the SLAs defined in advance with the cloud service provider. This creates a strong dependence in the cloud provider, and gives little room for maneuver when the cloud customers need to adapt the infrastructure very quickly to avoid service degradations. 

In this paper we present a framework that aims to reduce this gap. The SHõWA framework is targeted for self-healing Web-based applications. It detects workload and performance anomalies from the consumer perspective and interacts with the cloud service provider to dynamically adjust the infrastructure. From the experimental study conducted, is noteworthy the role of SHõWA to avoid the degradation of service upon the occurrence of load and resource contention scenarios.","A Framework for Self-Healing and Self-Adaptation of Cloud-Hosted Web-Based Applications","cloud computing, elasticity, fail-stutter, performance anomalies, self-healing",2013-12-04,2013,1,Y,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4
4259,227,"SHõWA: A Self-Healing Framework for Web-Based Applications","The complexity of systems is considered an obstacle to the progress of the IT industry. Autonomic computing is presented as the alternative to cope with the growing complexity. It is a holistic approach, in which the systems are able to configure, heal, optimize, and protect by themselves. Web-based applications are an example of systems where the complexity is high. The number of components, their interoperability, and workload variations are factors that may lead to performance failures or unavailability scenarios. The occurrence of these scenarios affects the revenue and reputation of businesses that rely on these types of applications.

In this article, we present a self-healing framework for Web-based applications (SHõWA). SHõWA is composed by several modules, which monitor the application, analyze the data to detect and pinpoint anomalies, and execute recovery actions autonomously. The monitoring is done by a small aspect-oriented programming agent. This agent does not require changes to the application source code and includes adaptive and selective algorithms to regulate the level of monitoring. The anomalies are detected and pinpointed by means of statistical correlation. The data analysis detects changes in the server response time and analyzes if those changes are correlated with the workload or are due to a performance anomaly. In the presence of performance anomalies, the data analysis pinpoints the anomaly. Upon the pinpointing of anomalies, SHõWA executes a recovery procedure. We also present a study about the detection and localization of anomalies, the accuracy of the data analysis, and the performance impact induced by SHõWA. Two benchmarking applications, exercised through dynamic workloads, and different types of anomaly were considered in the study. The results reveal that (1) the capacity of SHõWA to detect and pinpoint anomalies while the number of end users affected is low; (2) SHõWA was able to detect anomalies without raising any false alarm; and (3) SHõWA does not induce a significant performance overhead (throughput was affected in less than 1%, and the response time delay was no more than 2 milliseconds).","self-healing, reliability, performance, Self-healing, autonomic computing, Web applications, fault tolerance",,2015-03-01,2015,3,N,"Luís Silva",luis@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/227_Luis_photo.jpg,1967-08-10,luis,4

The data partitioning approach partition the facts tables through all nodes and replicates the dimension tables. The replication of the dimension tables creates a limitation to the applicability of the DWS technique to data warehouses with big dimensions. This paper proposes a strategy to handle large dimensions in a distributed DWS system and evaluates the proposed strategy experimentally. With the proposed strategy the performance speed up and scale up obtained in the DWS technique are not affected by the presence of big dimensions.

Although the technique proposed is completely general, we believe it is particularly advantageous for the compression of medium size and large dimension tables in data warehouses. In fact, dimensions usually have a high number of text attributes and a reduction in the size of middle or large dimension have a big impact in the execution time of queries that join that dimension with the fact tables. In general, the high complexity and long execution time of most data warehouse queries make the compression of dimension text attributes (and possible text attributes that may exist in the fact table, such as false facts) an effective approach to speed up query response time.

1367,235,"Bases de Dados de Texto: a Gestão de Documentos Armazenados numa Base de Dados Relacional","This dissertation focuses on Text Databases, which has grown in interest and relevance in the last years. In fact, text databases are now particularly relevant in several contexts and application areas such as administration of organization documents, digital libraries, creation of automated dictionaries and encyclopedias, and in any problem dealing with the storage and retrieval of textual information. These databases manage efficiently the textual information through the use of the Relational Databases technologies in combination with the indexing and searching techniques of the Information Retrieval. However, the integration of the information retrieval techniques in the database systems has not been easy and several approaches have emerged for this problem. 
This work presents a survey on text databases and discusses the fundamental theoretical concepts of databases and information retrieval and the main approaches for the integration of databases systems and information retrieval systems.
The ExpSRI system, specifically developed for the study done in this dissertation, allows the manipulation of textual information stored in a text database of large capacity. This database is managed by a DataBase Management System &#40;DBMS&#41; that also integrates information (textual) retrieval techniques. The experimental setup done around the ExpSRI system holds a large test collection (˜473000 documents) and has been used as a test
bench. As the aim of a retrieval information system is to find the textual information required by the system users, it is important to assess the effectiveness of these systems.
The effectiveness evaluation of the ExpSRI has been based on the experimental evaluation of measures such as precision, recall, precision versus recall and R-Precision. The analysis performed to the results obtained during ExpSRI evaluation permitted the identification of the main factors that can influence the effectiveness of information retrieval systems.","Information Retrieval and Text Databases","Text Databases, Information Retrieval, Oracle ConText",2002-11-30,2002,7,Y,"Olga Marina Freitas Craveiro",olga.craveiro@ipleiria.pt,235_,1972-09-22,marine,4

Indeed, the temporal dimension plays a key role on most of these systems, promoting better performance. Our goal is the definition of a temporal document representation, incorporating the time dimension into information retrieval model to improve the quality of the results. Our approach is based on temporal segmentation of documents. Temporal-aware retrieval models may explore a richer temporal document representation, enabled by segmentation. To achieve this, first we must identify temporal expressions and capture, when possible, their normalized time values. Starting from our prior work on temporal expressions recognition, we present in this paper, a resolution tool that achieves promising results in a Portuguese collection.

No entanto, a utilização de informação temporal para melhorar os resultados das pesquisas tem sido pouco explorada, apesar de existir um grande potencial para conseguir
esse melhoramento. De facto, a noção de tempo é essencial para muitas das pesquisas efectuadas num sistema de recolha de informação, como por exemplo, na área da saúde onde será pertinente reconstruir o historial clínico dos pacientes com a capacidade de encontrar eventos e apresentá-los num espaço temporal, permitindo, desta forma, dar maior exactidão ao relatório (Alonso et al., 2007). 
No entanto, nem sempre o tempo surge de forma explícita nos documentos, mas as referências temporais podem ajudar a identificar a relevância dos documentos encontrados. O interesse no processamento de informação temporal tem crescido nos últimos anos e tem-se intensificado nas mais diversas áreas de investigação.
O objectivo do sistema que desenvolvemos é o de identificar informação temporal existente em documentos, para posteriormente ser utilizada, como papel importante na ordenação da lista de resultados obtida pelas pesquisas efectuadas em sistemas de recolha de informação.
Como existe ainda pouco trabalho desenvolvido no processamento de informação temporal da língua portuguesa, decidimos criar um sistema de raiz que seguisse um algoritmo simples e rápido.

360,2088,"Plug and Play Fault Injector for Dependability Benchmarking","The increased reliance of our society on computers requires that their dependability be measured. Benchmarks with that objective must include fault injectors that are very simple to use. They should be downloadable from the web together with the other components of the benchmark, be able to target all system components, and should not require any complex setup or installation procedure. Since the existing injectors did not fulfill this requirement, we have developed DBench-FI, a fault injector for dependability benchmarking that is very simple to install and use. DBench-FI belongs to the software implemented fault injection (SWIFI) family, since no special hardware can be used for this purpose. The current version targets the Linux OS on Intel processors, and uses a flexible runtime kernel upgrading algorithm to allow access to the target process memory space, that can be in either user or system space, enabling in this way the injection of faults. Furthermore, it does not require the availability of the source code of any system component or user process. It is not based on any debug mode either, being able to inject faults even in tasks that were already running when it is installed, irrespective of their complexity, like the Oracle Database Management System that is used in the examples in the paper. This set of features is, to the best of our knowledge, unique. It currently only injects memory faults, but there are plans to include other fault models in the future.

Tais facilidades não deverão ser, contudo, restritivas no que concerne às capacidades de injecção, devendo esses injectores ser capazes de, em particular, injectar falhas quer no espaço do sistema quer no espaço do utilizador, independentemente da complexidade da aplicação alvo. 
Uma vez que os actuais injectores de falhas não preenchem esses requisitos, neste trabalho é apresentado um novo injector de falhas, denominado DBench-FI, implementado por software, capaz de colmatar essa lacuna. Através de uma metodologia inovadora, baseada num algoritmo de alteração automática do kernel do sistema operativo durante a execução, o DBench-FI é capaz de injectar falhas quer no espaço utilizador quer no espaço do sistema, sendo simultaneamente muito fácil de instalar, não exigindo qualquer conhecimento do código fonte, quer da aplicação alvo, quer do sistema operativo. Complementarmente, é capaz de injectar falhas em aplicações que, independentemente da sua complexidade, já se encontrem em execução na altura da sua instalação e não é baseado em qualquer ferramenta de debug, não apresentando, por isso, os inconvenientes associados a esse tipo de injectores.
Presentemente, o DBench-FI encontra-se disponível para o sistema operativo Linux e para os processadores Intel baseados na arquitectura IA-32, podendo, contudo, devido à elevada portabilidade do método em que assenta, ser facilmente adaptado a outros sistemas e processadores.

For being able to deploy such a model into real world applications, security is a vital concern. In the M&M project we have developed a system that departures from the traditional platform-based execution model for mobile agents. In M&M there are no agent platforms. Instead there is a component framework that allows the applications to become able of sending and receiving agents by themselves in a straightforward manner. In this paper we examine the security mechanisms available in M&M, and how integration with existing applications is done. One difficult aspect of this work is that all the features must work with the security mechanisms that already exist on the applications. This is so because the components are integrated from within into the applications, which already have security mechanisms in place. Currently, M&M provides features like fine-grain security permissions, encryption of agents and data, certificate distribution using LDAP and cryptographic primitives for agents.

Although exception handling was a significant improvement over other mechanisms like checking return codes, it's far from perfect. In fact, it can be argued that this mechanism is seriously flawed. In this paper we argue that exception handling should be automatically done at the runtime/operating system level. The motivation is similar to the one that lead to garbage collection: memory management was a tedious and error prone process, thus virtual machines included support for taking care of it. We believe that many exceptions can be automatically dealt with, and recovered, as long as appropriate mechanisms exist in the runtime environment.

models. Programming languages designers often neglect the exception mechanism and look at it more like an add-on for their language instead of central part. As a consequence, software quality suffers as programmers feel that the task of writing good error handling code is too complex, unattractive and inefficient. We propose a new model that automates the handling of exceptions by the runtime platform. This
model frees the programmer from having to write exception handling code and, at the same time, successfully increases the resilience of programs to abnormal situations.","Exception handling mechanisms",,2008-09-15,2008,1,U,"Bruno Cabral",bcabral@dei.uc.pt,1362238076_retrato_2_2.jpg,1978-08-27,bcabral,4
2148,2103,"Implementing Retry ' featuring AOP","Everyday experience tells us that some errors are transient, but also that some can be handled simply by 'retryingâ? the failed operation. For instance, a glitch on the network might turn a resource unreachable for a short period of time; or a sudden peak of work on a server can cause a momentary denial of service. In many occasions, without other kind of specialized recovery code, it is possible to keep a program running only by retrying a failed operation. Unfortunately, retry is not explicitly available on many platforms or programming languages and, even if it were, it could not be blindly used for dealing with every abnormal situation. On languages like C# or Java, or even on languages that offer the retry construct such as Smalltalk and Eiffel, where errors are represented and communicated through exceptions, there is no simple way to clear the effects of a failed operation and, thus, re-attempt its execution. Programmers have to explicitly write sometimes complex and error-prone code to repair the state of a program and the execution context. In this paper, we propose an AOP technique for implementing 'retryâ? on systems lacking such a feature without using any language extensions for AOP or imposing modifications to the development language. Our approach eliminates the need for programmers to write \""state-cleaning\"" code for normal objects by means of a transparent transactional mechanism and provides the means to identify non-idempotent operations on the code. In our evaluation we show that a relevant number of application failures can be masked using this approach.","Exception handling mechanisms",,2009-09-01,2009,1,U,"Bruno Cabral",bcabral@dei.uc.pt,1362238076_retrato_2_2.jpg,1978-08-27,bcabral,4

We have implemented this model in the Eve language, which includes a compiler that generates parallel tasks with synchronization on top of variables, and a work-stealing runtime that uses the epoll interface to manage the event loop.
We have also evaluated that model in micro-benchmarks in programs that are either CPU-intensive or IO-intensive with and without shared data. In CPU-intensive programs, it achieved results very close to multithreaded approaches. In the share-nothing IO-intensive benchmark it outperformed all other solutions.

This work proposes an elegant way of achieving such a goal.

The translation process interprets the AST nodes for signatures such as read-write access, execution-flow modifications, among others and generates a set of dependencies between executable tasks. This process has been applied to well known problems, such as the recursive Fibonacci and FFT algorithms, resulting in versions capable of maximizing resource usage.

Its main quality attributes are simplicity and expressiveness, allowing programmers to deal with exceptional situations in a concurrent setting in a familiar way. The proposal is centered on a new kind of exception type that defines new paths for exception propagation among concurrent threads of execution.

Nearly all modern languages have some form of “try-catch” model for exception handling and encourage its use. Nevertheless, this model has not seen significant change, even in the face of new challenges, such as concurrent programming and the advent of reactive programming. As it stands, the current model is reactive, rather than proactive — exceptions are raised, caught, and handled. We propose an alternative exception handling model — PreX — where exceptions are no longer caught but, rather, predicted and prevented. Online Failure Prediction techniques generally work at a very high level, showing potential for pre- diction of program crashes. However, these techniques have never been at the hands of the programmers as an effective tool to improve software quality. By applying recent advances in Online Failure Prediction, PreX aims to fully prevent exceptions, bringing failure prediction techniques to a much more fine-grained level that the programmer can control.

4499,2103,"Integrating Automatic Backward Error Recovery in Asynchronous Rich Clients","Rich Web Clients allow developers to manage data locally and update it from the server by means of asynchronous requests, thus providing more interactive interfaces and an improved user experience. On the other hand, they face concerning challenges regarding error management. When there is a need to update the local data through multiple asynchronous requests and it is required that all them succeed, an error on a single call can lead to having incorrect information shown to the user. Consequently, developers need to explicitly implement proper recovery mechanisms, a task that most of times is complex and highly error prone, leading to tangled code and harder maintenance, especially in an asynchronous environment. These problems could be lessened through automatic error recovery techniques, but the existing state of the art for Rich Web Client development does not support recovery from asynchronous scenarios. To cope with this problem we extended the existing error recovery technique of Reconstructors, adding to it the capability of recovering the state in the presence of several asynchronous requests. We applied this technology in a widely used open source project for rendering interactive charts, ChartJs, thus allowing the developer to effortlessly guarantee that the data shown to the user, even when it results from multiple asynchronous requests, is never inconsistent. We compare our proposal to other solutions using state of the art approaches and verify that by using Reconstructors the overall implementation requires 39.16% less lines of code, and 5.66 times less lines of code are dedicated specifically to error management, while avoiding code tangling completely. Execution time showed by reconstructors is between 5.2% and 9.3% slower than other solutions, a cost we believe is worth its benefits, and feasible for using these techniques in real world client applications.","Error Recovery",,0000-00-00,2016,1,N,"Bruno Cabral",bcabral@dei.uc.pt,1362238076_retrato_2_2.jpg,1978-08-27,bcabral,4

In this paper we further extend this technique by automating the process of stepping the simulation.

independent tasks, executed in hundreds or thousands of 
computers spread over the Internet. While these
applications typically do local checkpointing to deal with
failures, we propose to replicate those checkpoints in 
remote places to make them available to other worker nodes.

The main idea is to organize the worker nodes of a desktop
grid into a peer-to-peer Distributed Hash Table. Worker
nodes can take advantage of this P2P network to keep track,
share,manage and reclaim the space of the checkpoint files.
We used simulation to validate our system and we show that
remotely storing replicas of checkpoints can considerably
reduce the turnaround times of the tasks, when compared to
the traditional approaches where nodes manage their own
checkpoints locally. These results make us conclude that the

of results returned by participating hosts. Several mechanisms for result 
validation have been previously proposed. However, the characterization

and deployed a desktop grid application across several thousand hosts 
distributed over the Internet. We then analyzed the results to give quan- 
titative and empirical characterization of errors stemming from input or 
output (I/O) failures. We find that in practice, error rates are widespread 
across hosts but occur relatively infrequently. Moreover, we find that er-

hosts. In light of these characterization results, we evaluated state-of-

impact on the computing throughput of Desktop Grid systems, like BOINC. 
Currently, BOINC workers store their checkpoints locally. A major limitation 
of this approach is that whenever a worker leaves un&#64257;nished computation, no 
other worker can proceed from the last stable checkpoint. This forces tasks to be 
restarted from scratch when the original machine is no longer available. 

To overcome this limitation, we propose to share checkpoints between nodes. 
To organize this mechanism, we arrange nodes to form complete graphs (cliques), 
where nodes share all the checkpoints they compute. Cliques function as sur- 
vivable units, where checkpoints and tasks are not lost as long as one of the 
nodes of the clique remains alive. To simplify construction and maintenance of 
the cliques, we take advantage of the central supervisor of BOINC. To evaluate 
our solution, we combine simulation with some real data to answer the most 
fundamental question: what do we need to pay for increased throughput?","Desktop Grid",,2008-04-02,2008,1,U,"Filipe Araujo",filipius@uc.pt,2132_30082009-2.jpg,1973-10-29,filipius,4

Additionally, we show that FLDT1 is more robust than previous triangulation algorithms, because it does not require the strict UDG connectivity model to work. The small signaling cost of our algorithms allows us to improve routing performance, by effciently using the PLDel graph instead of sparser graphs, like the Gabriel or the Relative Neighborhood graphs.","Mobile Ad Hoc Networks",,2009-10-01,2009,3,U,"Filipe Araujo",filipius@uc.pt,2132_30082009-2.jpg,1973-10-29,filipius,4

2670,2132,"libboincexec: A generic virtualization approach for the BOINC middleware","BOINC is a client-server desktop grid middleware that has grown to power very large computational projects. BOINC clients request computing jobs to a central server and run them alongside other regular applications. Unfortunately, this kind of execution causes two kinds of problems. Firstly, developers must port their application to every single operating system target, which usually means maintaining several different versions of the same application. Secondly, any application running natively on desktop grid hardware is a potential security threat to the volunteer client.\\
During the course of this research we sought an efficient and generic method for alternative execution of jobs in BOINC clients. Our approach is strongly guided by the principles of non-intrusiveness and contains two main components. The first is a library, libboincexec, which is able to control several virtual machines monitors. The second is a modified BOINC wrapper that provides the glue between libboincexec and the middleware.\\
Through the use of this solution we are able to effectively use virtual machines to perform computation on desktop grids. This computation is inherently safe because virtual machines provide sandboxing. Additionally, by targeting the same virtual operating system, the problem of maintaining different versions of an application does not exist, thereby solving the heterogeneity problem of desktop grid nodes.","Grid Computing","boinc; desktop grids; virtualization; sandboxing;",2011-05-20,2011,1,Y,"Filipe Araujo",filipius@uc.pt,2132_30082009-2.jpg,1973-10-29,filipius,4

Tyche has a small $128$-bit state and an expected period length of $2^{127}$. Unlike most nonlinear generators, Tyche is consistently fast across architectures, due to its very simple iteration function derived from ChaCha, one of today's fastest stream ciphers.

Tyche is especially amenable for the highly parallel environments we find today, in particular for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), where it enables a very large number of uncorrelated parallel streams running independently. For example, $2^{16}$ parallel independent streams are expected to generate about $2^{96}$ pseudorandom numbers each, without overlaps.

Additionally, we determine bounds for the period length and parallelism of our generators, and evaluate their statistical quality and performance. We compare Tyche and the variant Tyche-i to the XORWOW and TEA$_8$ generators in CPUs and GPUs.

We argue that currently existing centralized monitoring approaches (e.g., relying on a single solution provider, using single point of failure components) represent a huge risk, because a single vulnerability may compromise the entire monitoring infrastructure.

In this paper, we describe the TRONE approach to trustworthy monitoring, which relies on multiple components to achieve increased levels of reliance on the monitoring data and hence increased trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the TRONE framework for event dissemination, on security-oriented diagnosis based on collected events and on fast network adaptation in critical situations based on multi-homing application support.

Binary code obfuscation tools often come in two (sometimes overlapping) flavors. On the one hand there are ``binary protectors'', tools outside of the development chain that translate a compiled binary into another, less intelligible one. On the other hand there are software development kits that require a significant effort from the developer to ensure the program is adequately obfuscated.

To operate properly, these services often depend on the correctness of a fraction of replicas, usually over $2/3$ or $1/2$. Defying the ideal situation, economical reasons may tempt users to replicate critical services onto a single multi-tenant cloud infrastructure. Since this may expose users to correlated failures, we assess the risks for two kinds of majorities: a conventional one, related to the number of replicas, regardless of the machines where they run; and a second one, related to the physical machines where the replicas run. This latter case may exist in multi-tenant virtualized environments only. We evaluate crash-stop and Byzantine faults that may affect virtual machines or physical machines. Contrary to what one might expect, we conclude that replicas do not need to be evenly distributed by a fixed number of physical machines. On the contrary, we found cases where they should be as unbalanced as possible. We try to systematically identify the best defense for each kind of fault and majority to conserve.

In such environments, threats exist for both the donated resources and the submitters. On one hand volunteers need protection against code that inadvertently or maliciously might harm their resources. Indeed, a volunteer project disrupting the regular working of the volunteer machines would have serious public relation consequences seriously hindering the public perception of volunteer computing. On the other hand, the behavior and results produced by volunteers need to be properly scrutinized to detect inappropriate actions and/or erroneous results, and thus ensure the dependability of the performed computations.
Therefore, security and dependability are two major goals that need to be carefully considered for a successful desktop grid experience. However, as we shall see in this chapter, security and dependability are complex issues, with many desktop grid frameworks addressing both issues in a less than perfect way. Thus, the volunteering of resources and submission of tasks still require a fairly amount of implicit trust between donors and harvesters.

Cloud operators use multi-tenancy, by grouping virtual machines (VMs) into a few physical machines (PMs), to pool computing resources, thus offering elasticity to clients. Although cloud-based fault tolerance schemes impose communication and synchronization overheads, the cloud offers excellent facilities for critical applications, as it can host varying numbers of replicas in independent resources. Given these contradictory forces, determining whether the cloud can host elastic critical services is a major research question. We address this challenge from the perspective of a standard three-tiered system with relational data.  We propose to tolerate Byzantine faults using groups of replicas placed on distinct physical machines, as a means to avoid exposing applications to correlated failures. To improve the scalability of our system, we divide data to enable parallel accesses. Using a realistic setup, this setting can reach speedups largely exceeding the number of partitions. Even for a wide variation of the load, the system preserves latency and throughput within reasonable bounds. We believe that the elasticity we observe demonstrates the feasibility of tolerating Byzantine faults in a cloud-based server using a relational database.

Despite the growing importance, HTTP-based applications are quite exposed to network failures, which can bring in huge losses to the service users and providers, including financial and reputation losses. Several approaches try to achieve reliable communication by using logging and retransmission of whole HTTP messages, which is especially ill-adapted to large messages. Stream-based approaches are more efficient as, upon failure, they transparently resume data transmission from where it stopped. Despite this, designing a stream-based mechanism involves significant challenges, as it is very difficult to know how much data is lost due to failure. In this paper we propose a stream-based mechanism for reliable HTTP communication that is entirely based on HTTP messages and is compatible with existing software. The mechanism is presented as a design pattern and relieves developers from explicitly handling connection failures, providing a standard way for building more reliable applications.

Since cloud resources grow and shrink as needed, providers and users of the cloud must carefully determine the exact amount of such resources they need. For this reason, getting accurate and timely information from the system is of paramount importance to properly adjust the means serving a given application. However, previous attempts to detect bottlenecks have resulted in complex, heavy and customized frameworks that lack any sort of standardization and may change widely from provider to provider. Improved monitoring mechanisms should be independent from the server technology, should require little to no configuration and should provide information of the real quality of service offered to clients.

To reach these goals, we intend to observe the server infrastructure from the outside and gather the smallest possible number of metrics from the inside. We undertook several experiments in a controlled server, to identify the patterns that correspond to bottlenecks. These experiments clearly show that one can actually diagnose different bottlenecks, by analyzing response times on browsers. These results pave the way to future monitoring mechanisms, mostly based on quality of service evidence, supported by user data.

4442,2132,"Online Client-Side Bottleneck Identification on HTTP Server Infrastructures","Ensuring short response times is a major concern for all web site administrators. To keep these times under control, they usually resort to monitoring tools that collect a large spectrum of system metrics, such as CPU and memory occupation, network traffic, number of processes, etc. Despite providing a reasonably accurate picture of the server, the times that really matter are those experienced by the user. However, not surprisingly, system administrators will usually not have access to these end-to-end figures, due to their lack of control over web browsers.
To overcome this problem, we follow the opposite approach of monitoring a site based on times collected from browsers. We use two browser-side metrics for this: $i$) the time it takes for the first byte of the response to reach the user (request time) and $ii$) the time it takes for the entire response to arrive (response time). We conjecture that an appropriate choice of the resources to control, more precisely, one or two URLs, suffices to detect CPU, network and I/O bottlenecks. In support of this conjecture, we run periodical evaluations of request and response times on some very popular web sites to detect bottlenecks.
Our experiments suggest that collecting data from the browsers can indeed contribute for better monitoring tools that provide a deeper understanding of the system, thus helping to maintain faster, more interactive web sites.","Distributed Systems",,2015-06-21,2015,1,Y,"Filipe Araujo",filipius@uc.pt,2132_30082009-2.jpg,1973-10-29,filipius,4

3129,2179,"TRONE: Trustworthy and Resilient Operations in a Network Environment","Cloud infrastructures play an increasingly important role for telecom operators, because they enable internal consolidation of resources with the corresponding savings in hardware and management costs. However, this same consolidation exposes core services of the infrastructure to very disruptive attacks. This is indeed the case with monitoring, which needs to be dependable and secure to ensure proper operation of large datacenters and cloud infrastructures. We argue that currently existing centralized monitoring approaches (e.g., relying on a single solution provider, using single point of failure components) represent a huge risk, because a single vulnerability may compromise the entire monitoring infrastructure.

In this paper, we describe the TRONE approach to trustworthy monitoring, which relies on multiple components to achieve increased levels of reliance on the monitoring data and hence increased trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the TRONE framework for event dissemination, on security-oriented diagnosis based on collected events and on fast network adaptation in critical situations based on multi-homing application support.

To validate our work, we will deploy and demonstrate our solutions in a live environment provided by Portugal Telecom.

This latter case may exist in multi-tenant virtualized environments only. We evaluate crash-stop and Byzantine faults that may affect virtual machines or physical machines.

This paper presents methodological indications for implementing RTDW, in which transactional data sources are available through common standard database access, allowing to minimize the time needed to accomplish extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) processes of that data, as well as its loading into the DW. The main method presented consists on using structural replicas of all fact tables without primary keys or index files, adapting those replica’s data structures for housing, in real-time, all insert, edit and delete operations (data transactions) that occur within operational systems databases. This is accomplished using only append record operations towards those fact table replicas, allowing to minimize processing time, record locking and concurrency data access problems, both in transactional systems and the DW.

2489,2229,"A 24/7 Monitorization Tool for Avoiding Hypotensive Episodes in Critical Care","The sudden fall of blood pressure (hypotension) is a common complication in medical care. In critical care patients, hypotension (HT) may cause serious heart, endocrine or neurological disorders, inducing severe or even lethal events. Moreover, recent studies report an increase of mortality in HT prone hemodialysis patients in need of critical care. If HT could be predicted in advance, medical staff could take action to minimize its effects, or even avoid its occurrence. Typically, most medical systems have focused on monitoring and detecting current patient status, rather than determining biosignal trends or predicting a patient’s future status. Therefore, predicting HT episodes in advance remains a challenge. Furthermore, since critical care actions such as hemodialysis are oftenly inconvenient and uncomfortable procedures, HT prediction or detection methods should be non-invasive, whenever possible. In this paper, we present a solution for continuous monitorization and prediction of HT episodes, using heart rate (HR) and mean blood pressure (BP) non-invasive measured biosignals. We propose an architecture for a HT Predictor (HTP) Tool, presenting a set of tools and a real-time database capable of continuously storing and real-time monitoring all patient’s historical HR and BP biosignal data, and efficiently alerting both probable and detected occurrences of HT episodes for each patient for the following 60 minutes. Additionally, the system promotes medical staff mobility, by taking advantage of using mobile personal devices such as mobile phones and PDA’s, optimizing human resources. Finally, an experimental evaluation on real-life data from the well known Physionet database shows the efficiency of the tool, outperforming the winning proposal of the Physionet 2009 Challenge.","Healthcare Information Systems","Hypotension detection and prediction, Medical and health care systems and applications, Biosignals analysis and processing",2010-08-17,2010,1,N,"Ricardo Jorge Santos",lionsoftware.ricardo@gmail.com,1352114105_90149.jpg,1972-05-29,rjrs,4

A large amount of wide-ranging techniques have been used in research to overcome this problem. Bit-based techniques such as bitmap indexes and bitmap join indexes have been used and are generally accepted as standard common practice for optimizing data warehouses. These techniques are very promising due to their relatively low overhead and fast bitwise operations. In this paper, we propose a new technique which performs optimized row selection for decision support queries, introducing a bit-based attribute into the fact table. This attribute’s value for each row is set according to its relevance for processing each decision support query by using bitwise operations. Simply inserting a new column in the fact table’s structure and using bitwise operations for performing row selection makes it a simple and practical technique, which is easy to implement in any Database Management System. The experimental results, using benchmark TPC-H, demonstrates that it is an efficient optimization method which significantly improves query performance.","Performance Optimization","OLAP Query Performance Optimization, Bitmap and Bitwise Operations in OLAP",2009-05-07,2009,1,N,"Ricardo Jorge Santos",lionsoftware.ricardo@gmail.com,1352114105_90149.jpg,1972-05-29,rjrs,4

Our Query Cache Tool takes advantage of previously executed queries, storing their results and the current state of the data which was accessed. Future queries only need to execute against the new data, inserted since the queries were last executed, and join these results with the previous ones. This makes query execution much faster, because we only need to process the most recent data. Our tool also minimizes the execution time and resource consumption for similar queries simultaneously executed by different users, putting the most recent ones on hold until the first finish and returns the results for all of them. The stored query results are held until they are considered outdated, then automatically erased.

Traditional data warehouses are unable to support any dynamics in structure and content while they are available for OLAP. Their data is periodically updated because they are unprepared for continuous data integration. For real-time enterprises with needs in decision support while the transactions are occurring, (near) real-time data warehousing seem very promising. In this paper we present a survey on testing today’s most used loading techniques and analyze which are the best data loading methods, presenting a methodology for efficiently supporting continuous data integration for data warehouses. To accomplish this, we use techniques such as table structure replication with minimum content and query predicate restrictions for selecting data, to enable loading data in the data warehouse continuously, with minimum impact in query execution time. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method using benchmark TPC-H and executing query workloads while simultaneously performing continuous data integration.","Real-Time Data Warehousing","Real-time and active data warehousing, Continuous data integration, ETL, Refreshment loading process, Performance Optimization",2009-09-17,2009,1,N,"Ricardo Jorge Santos",lionsoftware.ricardo@gmail.com,1352114105_90149.jpg,1972-05-29,rjrs,4
2848,2229,"The HTP Tool: Monitoring, Detecting and Predicting Hypotensive Episodes in Critical Care","The sudden fall of blood pressure (hypotension - HT) is a common complication in medical care. In critical care patients, HT may cause serious neurological, heart, or endocrine disorders, inducing severe or even lethal events. Recent studies report an increase of mortality in HT prone hemodialysis patients in need of critical care. Predicting HT episodes in advance is crucial to enable medical staff to minimize its effects or even avoid its occurrence. Most medical systems have focused on monitoring and detecting current patient status, rather than determining biosignal trends or predicting the patient’s future status. Therefore, predicting HT episodes in advance remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a solution for continuous monitoring and efficient prediction of HT episodes. We propose an architecture for a HT Predictor (HTP) Tool, capable of continuously storing and real-time monitoring all patient’s heart rate and blood pressure biosignal data, alerting probable occurrences of each patient’s HT episodes for the following 60 minutes, based on non-invasive hemodynamic variables. Our system also promotes medical staff mobility, taking advantage of using mobile personal devices such as cell phones and PDA’s. An experimental evaluation on real-life data from the well-known Physionet database shows the tool’s efficiency, outperforming the winning proposal of the Physionet 2009 Challenge.","Healthcare Information Systems","Intelligent medical and health care systems; Biosignals analysis and processing; Hypotension detection and prediction",2011-04-28,2011,1,N,"Ricardo Jorge Santos",lionsoftware.ricardo@gmail.com,1352114105_90149.jpg,1972-05-29,rjrs,4

2850,2229,"24/7 Real-Time Data Warehousing: A Tool for Continuous Actionable Knowledge","Technological evolution has redefined many business models. Many decision makers are now required to act near real-time, instead of periodically, given the latest transactional information. Decision-making occurs much more frequently and considers the latest business data. Since data warehouses (DWs) are the core of business intelligence, decision support systems need to deal with 24/7 real-time requirements. Thus, the ability to deal with continuous data loading and decision support availability simultaneously is critical, for producing continuous actionable knowledge. The main challenge in this context is to efficiently manage the DW’s refreshment, when data sources change, to recapture consistency and accuracy with those sources, while maintaining OLAP availability and database performance. This paper proposes a simple, fast and efficient solution based on database replication and temporary tables to change a traditional enterprise DW into a real-time DW, enabling continuous data loading and OLAP availability on a 24/7 schedule. Experimental evaluations using a real-world DW and the TPC-H decision support benchmark show its advantages and analyze its impact in OLAP performance.","Real-Time Data Warehousing","Real-time data warehousing, ETL, Continuous data loading, OLAP, Availability, Actionable knowledge",2011-07-20,2011,1,U,"Ricardo Jorge Santos",lionsoftware.ricardo@gmail.com,1352114105_90149.jpg,1972-05-29,rjrs,4

However, given the volume of data typically processed by DW queries, the existing encryption solutions heavily increase storage space and introduce very large overheads in query response time, due to decryption costs. In many cases, this performance degradation makes encryption unfeasible for use in DWs. In this paper we propose a transparent data masking solution for numerical values in DWs based on the mathematical modulus operator, which can be used without changing user application and DBMS source code. Our solution provides strong data security while introducing small overheads in both storage space and database performance. Several experimental evaluations using the TPC-H decision support benchmark and a real-world DW are included.

Distributed data using round-robin algorithms on clusters of shared-nothing machines is commonly used for improving performance. In this paper, we propose a solution for distributed DW databases that ensures its continuous availability and deals with frequent data loading requirements, introducing small performance overhead. We use a data striping and replication architecture to distribute portions of each fact table among pairs of slave nodes. Each slave node is an exact replica of its partner in the pair. This allows balancing query execution and replacing any defective node, ensuring the system’s continuous availability. The size of each portion in a given node depends on its individual features, namely performance benchmark measures and dedicated database RAM. The estimated cost for executing each query workload in each slave node is also used for balancing and optimizing query performance. We include experiments using the TPC-H decision support benchmark to evaluate the scalability of our solution and show that it outperforms standard round-robin distributed DW setups.","Real-Time Data Warehousing","Real-time data warehousing; availability; fault tolerance; data replication and redundancy; distributed and parallel databases; load balancing; performance optimization",2012-07-18,2012,1,U,"Ricardo Jorge Santos",lionsoftware.ricardo@gmail.com,1352114105_90149.jpg,1972-05-29,rjrs,4

However, when executing robustness tests, a very large amount of service responses has to be manually classified to distinguish regular responses from responses that indicate robustness problems. Besides requiring a large amount of time and effort, this complex classification process can easily lead to errors resulting from the human intervention in such a laborious task. Text classification algorithms have been applied successfully in many contexts (e.g., spam identification, text categorization, etc) and are considered a powerful tool for the successful automation of several classification-based tasks. In this paper we present a study on the applicability of five widely used text classification algorithms in the context of web services robustness testing. In practice, we assess the effectiveness of Support Vector Ma-chines, Naïve Bayes, Large Linear Classification, K-nearest neighbor (Ibk), and Hyperpipes in classifying web services responses. Results indicate that these algorithms can be effec-tively used to automate the identification of robustness issues while reducing human intervention.

Previous research indicates that well-known automatic classification algorithms can be used to automate this step. However, the applicability of such algorithms is also limited, as they are frequently unable to deal with the large diversity of outputs present in typical WS scenarios, thus producing incorrect results. In this paper we propose an approach that allows the automatic classification of the results of WS robustness tests. The technique integrates rule-based classification (including domain rules) and conventional machine-learning algorithms trained using generic data. The proposed approach was used to classify a large set of results of tests performed over publicly available WS and also over in-house implementations of several TPC benchmarks.

1411,2289,"An Empirical Approach to Assess Software Off-The-Shelf Components Using Fault Injection","Rigorous verification and validation of space software systems has always been mandatory, as these systems once deployed cannot be maintained, in most cases. Additionally, due to the intrinsic criticality of this type of systems, the failure of a given component might mean the loss of the mission. Nowadays, one can observe that off-the-shelf (OTS) components (or commercial off-the-shelf - COTS) are being used in onboard space systems (e.g. operating systems, run time libraries, etc.) in order to reduce project costs. The use of OTS components in real time safety critical applications may increase the failure probability, since these components are not designed and developed for environment with strict timing and/or safety requirements. The assessment approach proposed in this paper is based on the joint use of robustness testing (interface fault injection) and a particular fault injection technique named G-SWFIT that injects realistic software faults. The proposed toolset is meant both for 1) revealing OTS components vulnerabilities, which is suitable to be used early in the system life cycle, and 2) assess the impact of component failures in the entire system, within the 1st steps of validation. An example of using the proposed approach in a satellite data handling software prototype is also presented.","Verification and validation",,2006-05-22,2006,1,U,"Ricardo Barbosa",rbarbosa@criticalsoftware.com,NULL,NULL,,4
1413,2289,"Injection of faults at component interfaces and inside the component code: are they equivalent?","The injection of interface faults through API parameter corruption is a technique commonly used in experimental dependability evaluation. Although the interface faults injected by this approach can be considered as a possible consequence of actual software faults in real applications, the question of whether the typical exceptional inputs and invalid parameters used in these techniques do represent the consequences of software bugs is largely an open issue. This question may not be an issue in the context of robustness testing aimed at the identification of weaknesses in software components. However, the use of interface faults by API parameter corruption as a general approach for dependability evaluation in component-based systems requires an in depth study of interface faults and a close observation of the way internal component faults propagate to the component interfaces. In this work we present the results of experimental evaluation of realistic component-based applications developed in Java and C using the injection of interface faults by API parameter corruption and the injection of software faults inside the components by modification of the target code. The faults injected inside software components emulate typical programming errors and are based on an extensive field data study previously published. The results show the consequences of internal component faults in several operational scenarios and provide empirical evidences that interface faults and software component faults cause different impact in the system.","Fault Injection",,2006-10-16,2006,1,U,"Ricardo Barbosa",rbarbosa@criticalsoftware.com,NULL,NULL,,4
1415,2289,"Verification and Validation of (Real Time) COTS Products using Fault Injection Techniques","With the goal of reducing time to market and project costs, the current trend of real time business and mission critical systems is evolving from the development of custom made applications to the use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) products. Obviously, the same confidence and quality of the custom made software components is expected from the commercial applications. In most cases, such products (COTS) are not designed with stringent timing and/or safety requirements as priorities. Thus, to decrease the gap between the use of custom made components and COTS components, this paper presents a methodology for evaluating COTS products in the scope of dependable, real time systems, through the application of fault injection techniques at key points of the software engineering process. By combining the use of robustness testing (fault injection at interface level) with software fault injection (using educated fault injection operators), a COTS component can be assessed in the context of the system it will belong to, with special emphasis given to timing and safety constraints that are usually imposed by the target real time dependable environment. In the course of this work, three case studies have been performed to assess the methodology using realistic scenarios that used common COTS products.","Verification and validation",,2007-02-26,2007,1,U,"Ricardo Barbosa",rbarbosa@criticalsoftware.com,NULL,NULL,,4
1419,2289,"Experimental Risk Assessment and Comparison Using Software Fault Injection","One important question in component-based software development is how to estimate the risk of using COTS components, as the components may have hidden faults and typically the source code is not available for analysis. This question is particularly relevant in scenarios where it is necessary to choose the most reliable COTS when several alternative components of equivalent functionality are available. The estimated risk introduced in the system by each component can help the system integrator in such cases. This paper proposes a practical approach to assess the risk of using a given software component (COTS or non COTS). Although we focus on comparing components, the methodology can be useful to assess the risk in individual modules. The proposed approach uses the injection of realistic residual software faults to assess the impact of possible component failures and uses software complexity metrics to estimate the probability of residual defects in software components. The proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated in a comparison scenario using two real and competing off-the-shelf components (the RTEMS and the RTLinux real time operating system) in a realistic application of a satellite data handling application used by the European Space Agency.","Fault Injection",,2007-06-25,2007,1,U,"Ricardo Barbosa",rbarbosa@criticalsoftware.com,NULL,NULL,,4

Some features should then be provided by the system to seize and maintain the enthusiasm of users that contribute the CPU idle cycles of their machines. A possible solution is to provide a Web-page with statistics about the
contribution time and computational power offered by each individual user or institution.
In this paper, we present the design of JET-STATS, a server of statistics that was developed in our project. The server was implemented inside a HTTP daemon and several optimization techniques have been used for the sake of efficiency.

ATM security is concerned with securing the ATM assets, to prevent threats and limit their effects on the overall aviation network. This effect limitation could be achieved by removing the vulnerability from the system and/or increasing the tolerance in case of component failures due to attacks. 
The security risk assessment methodology proposed is based on what is currently being done by the industry and international organisations (International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Common Criteria (CC), International Standard Organisation (ISO), EUROCONTROL Guidance Material, etc.) and comprises five main stages.

The focus moved from “safety” to “security”: from the prevention and mitigation of casual and unexpected events to the mitigation of deliberate acts. Regarding the protection of particular critical assets as vessels and ports or aircrafts and airports, respectively International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) developed two different methodologies for security management, both taking into account that “total security” would be attainable only with an infinite cost. IMO, through the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code (ref. to IMO, 2002), has stated that countermeasures have to be identified and implemented in a scalable way, according to the “security level”. Nevertheless, “security level” is the result of intelligence information, whose trustworthiness is in inverse relation to malicious people’s capability to act by surprise, which undoubtedly increases the success of their actions. Therefore, security risk assessment and consequent countermeasures should set aside intelligence information and base their cost-effectiveness on other considerations. This paper aims at proposing an innovative methodology for security risk management that allows the identification of cost-effective countermeasures, based on the evaluation of the impact of each potential incident, independently from the “security level”.

Almost every mobile device has Bluetooth (BT) capabilities and this powerful combination widely used in our daily life is coming to new environments like the car and the military industries. As any technology, BT has security issues that hackers have extensively exploited over the years, while users seem not to care too much. To raise the security awareness we present an analysis of BT attack methods and tools over time. We paid particular attention to the severity, possible targets and the ability to persist over new versions of BT.

On the other hand, grids consist on the aggregation of distributed computational resources and presentation of these as a single service with a common interface. The deployment of distributed data warehouses on a grid architecture with QoS control strategies could lead to high levels of flexibility, scalability, reliability and efficiency. However, due to grids characteristics, it could also lead to great challenges. In this paper we investigate an efficient architecture to deploy large data warehouses in grids with high availability and good load balancing.

Hence, they are not prepared to provide differentiation for quality of service. In this paper we consider the distributed grid-DWPA architecture context, which fragments and replicates data into several sites to provide an efficient grid data warehouse solution. Instead of offering best-effort service to every query, we propose the use of a performance predict model that is used in conjunction with QoS oriented scheduling to enable the establishment of service level agreements (SLA).","Architecture for SLA in grid-warehouses","SLA, query scheduling, grid-warehouses",2007-09-06,2007,1,Y,"Rogério Luís de Carvalho Costa",rogcosta@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2406_,1975-01-01,rogcosta,4

Network managers, application servers and grid resource managers are examples of software that is often QoS-enabled. On the other hand, database servers usually provide a best-effort model, answering each query as fast as possible. Thus, they are not prepared to provide QoS differentiation for incoming queries. In this work, we present an external control system for QoS-oriented scheduling of database requests. Our external system prioritizes queries and automatically adjusts the number of queries that are concurrently executed (degree of multi-programming) in order to achieve user-specified Service Level Objectives (SLO). There are works on external schedulers, admission control systems and on the specification of the degree of multi-programming, but most focus on best-effort models and do not consider Service Level Objectives. Our experimental results show that our approach is effective and that using a specialized scheduler for achieving SLO is very important.

Scheduling query execution in these environment is an important issue. Centralized and hierarchical scheduling architectures are between the most commonly used scheduling architectures in distributed databases and grid computing, respectively. Each architectural model has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we evaluate the usage of both models in querying highly distributed data. We consider several scheduling policies and experimentally compare scheduling models and policies in terms of throughput and SLO-fulfillment.

Although there have been some previous proposals for query scheduling in distributed databases, they did not consider site reputation, which is important in autonomous and heterogeneous distributed systems. We propose a reputation-based election-inspired query scheduling strategy. Sites are autonomous concerning candidacy for answering queries, in which case they must report an expected response time commitment to those queries. A reputation system is used for ranking sites on their response time estimations. Commitment information and subsequent outcome allows the reputation-based election-inspired approach to improve the overall mean response time of the system. We compare it experimentally with other distributed schedulers to show that the use of reputation and elections improves performance in heterogeneous autonomous environments.","Query scheduling over the grid","reputation, query scheduling, distributed databases",2009-05-18,2009,1,Y,"Rogério Luís de Carvalho Costa",rogcosta@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2406_,1975-01-01,rogcosta,4

In this chapter we propose two key inter-related enabler technologies for this vision: a parallel query optimizer which is able to optimize queries in any parallel DW independently of the underlying database management system &#40;DBMS&#41;, and a scheduling approach for Grid DWs, which decides in which Grid site a query should be executed.We experimentally prove that the approaches allow the community Data Warehouse to work efficiently.

It typically builds on the concept of files, sites and file transfers between sites. These use a data transfer service, plus a replica manager to keep track of where replicas are located. The authors consider a multi-site, grid-aware data warehouse, which is a large distributed repository sharing a schema and data concerning scientific or business domains. Differently from typical grid scenarios, the data warehouse is not simply a set of files and accesses to individual files. It is a single distributed schema and both localized and distributed computations must be managed over that schema. Given this difference, it is important to study approaches for placement and computation over the grid data warehouse and this is our contribution in this book chapter.","Data replication and query scheduling in grid warehouses","data replication, query scheduling, grid-warehouses",2009-05-01,2009,5,Y,"Rogério Luís de Carvalho Costa",rogcosta@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2406_,1975-01-01,rogcosta,4
2706,2406,"Quality of Experience in Database Systems","This work aims at providing mechanisms to increase users' satisfaction when using database systems. We express users' satisfaction in terms of Quality of Experience (QoE). Therefore, our proposals aim to increase the degree of QoE a database system provides.

Traditional database systems execute operations immediately upon submission
and, since they do not allow users to express execution-related constraints, they do not evaluate whereas those constraints are covered, and they do not take corrective action when necessary.

Our proposal for QoE makes the database system take into consideration users'
expectations on deciding how or when to execute operations. This is based on a set of Data Access Requirements (DAR) that users can associate to database operations and the QoE-prepared system considers those when processing the operations.

Since the objective of the QoE-oriented database system is to provide user
satisfaction, the analysis of its performance must consider success rate measures on achieving the user specified constraints. We have defined Key Performance Indicators based on such measures and used those as part of our comparison of approaches.

Our proposed Data Access Requirements (DARs) include execution deadlines,
execution start and end times, data availability, data freshness, execution priority, disconnected execution and job repetition. Some of those, such as execution deadlines, are useful in any data processing architecture - centralized, parallel or distributed – whereas DARs such as availability are especially designed for parallel and distributed contexts.

For the proposed approach to work on any of those architectures we needed to
develop a set of features that includes runtime estimations, requirements-based task scheduling and future jobs monitor and scheduling.
Besides that, we also developed some other features required for parallel and
distributed QoE-oriented database systems. Those include an election-based global scheduler, capacity to evaluate data availability degree and capacity to decide on data replication. Another important aspect in parallel and distributed settings was the development of reputation strategies. These allow the system to constantly have updated quantitative information on the degree of QoE expectations fulfillment by nodes or sites and, based on these, to adapt in order to maintain high QoE capabilities. Requirements fulfillment rates and runtime estimations are the bases of proposed reputation algorithms, which support better scheduling decisions.

We show experimentally, using benchmark scenarios, that the proposed QoEoriented database system is able to satisfy the user-defined execution-related constraints in both centralized, parallel and distributed cases. In order to do this we have created a prototype and tested the most important concepts proposed in this thesis. The approaches were compared with best effort (no QoE) counterparts and, when relevant, with scheduling approaches such as round-robin or on-demand.","QoE-oriented database systems","Quality of experience, Query scheduling, Data placement, Service level objectives, Data access requirements, Performance Indicators",2011-05-16,2011,6,Y,"Rogério Luís de Carvalho Costa",rogcosta@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2406_,1975-01-01,rogcosta,4
2707,2406,"Quality of experience in distributed databases","This paper proposes an approach to improve the level of Quality of Experience (QoE) that distributed database systems provide. 

Quality of Experience is a measure of users' satisfaction when using a certain service or application. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to provide mechanisms to increase users' satisfaction when accessing distributed database systems.

In traditional database systems, users cannot specify execution-related constraints. Then, the database system cannot evaluate if user expectations are satisfied and neither the system can take corrective actions when necessary.  

In this work, we present the QoE-oriented distributed database system &#40;QoE-DDB&#41;. It allow users to specify Data Access Requirements (DARs) and aims to please users by satisfying the DARs they define. We define a set of types of Data Access Requirements and propose some SQL extensions that enable users to specify execution-related requirements. Proposed types of DARs include execution deadline and priority, execution start and finish times, data availability and freshness degrees, and disconnected execution mode. 

In our QoE-DDB, each user's command is transformed into one or more tasks that are executed by data services. Community modules and local data services negotiate Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for each task, which improves the system's dependability. We propose both QoE-oriented scheduling and dynamic data placement strategies. Proposed architecture and scheduling strategies enable the system to be used in a wide range of distributed environments, from tightly-coupled homogeneous environments (e.g. composed by off-the-shelf computers connected by a LAN) to highly heterogeneous and geographically distributed systems, where data services have some degree of autonomy. 

Traditional performance indicators (e.g. throughput and response time) are not adequate to measure the QoE a system provides. We also propose some specialized Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to estimate the QoE level a database system provides. 

Finally, we present experimental results obtained through the use benchmark data and queries together with a prototype that implements proposed strategies. In our experiments, we consider realistic scenarios and compare proposed scheduling strategies with their best-effort oriented counterparts. Obtained results prove the importance of our QoE-oriented approach.","QoE in distributed database systems","Distributed database, Quality of experience, Query scheduling, Data placement, Service level objectives, Data access requirements, Performance Indicators",0000-00-00,2011,3,Y,"Rogério Luís de Carvalho Costa",rogcosta@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2406_,1975-01-01,rogcosta,4

1493,2437,"Proactive Re-optimization","Traditional query optimizers rely on the accuracy of estimated
statistics to choose good execution plans. This design often leads to
suboptimal plan choices for complex queries, since errors in
estimates for intermediate subexpressions grow exponentially in the
presence of skewed and correlated data distributions. Reoptimization
is a promising technique to cope with such mistakes.
Current re-optimizers first use a traditional optimizer to pick a
plan, and then react to estimation errors and resulting
suboptimalities detected in the plan during execution. The
effectiveness of this approach is limited because traditional
optimizers choose plans unaware of issues affecting reoptimization.
We address this problem using proactive reoptimization,

i) the uncertainty in estimates of statistics is computed in the form of

1839,2437,"Progressive Parametric Query Optimization","Commercial applications usually rely on pre-compiled parameterized procedures to interact with a database. Unfortunately, executing a procedure with a set of parameters different from those used at compilation time may be arbitrarily sub-optimal. Parametric query optimization (PQO) attempts to solve this problem by exhaustively determining the optimal plans at each point of the parameter space at compile time. However, PQO is likely not cost-effective if the query is executed infrequently or if it is executed with values only within a subset of the parameter space. In this paper we propose instead to progressively explore the parameter space and build a parametric plan during several executions of the same query. We introduce algorithms that, as parametric plans are populated, are able to frequently bypass the optimizer but still execute optimal or near-optimal plans.",Databases,"Databases, Query Optimization, Parametric Query Optimization",2009-04-01,2009,3,U,"David DeWitt",DeWitt,NULL,NULL,,4

is a promising technique to cope with such mistakes.
Current re-optimizers first use a traditional optimizer to pick a

It is in fact a dif?cult problem, since a visible change in the performance can result from some natural cause (e.g., workload variations, upgrades) or by some internal anomaly or fault that may end up in a performance failure or application crash.

Distinguish between the two scenarios is the goal of  the framework presented in this paper. Our framework is targeted for web-based and component-based  applications.  It  makes use of AOP-based monitoring, data correlation techniques and time-series alignment  algorithms to spot the occurrence of performance anomalies avoiding false alarms due to workload variations.

In this paper we present a framework extension devised to offer root-cause failure analysis for a given performance anomaly. The monitoring module enables application profiling and ANOVA analysis is used to verify if a performance anomaly is due to internal changes within the application (e.g., application updates) or to external changes (e.g., remote services changes, system/application server change). The paper includes some experimental results that show the effectiveness of our approach to pinpoint the root-cause for different types of performance anomalies and remarks its potential to avoid a considerable number of service failures.

In this paper we describe two algorithms for selective and adaptive profiling of web-based applications. The algorithms make use of a dynamic profiling interval and are mainly triggered when some of the transactions start presenting some symptoms of performance anomaly. The algorithms were tested under different types of degradation scenarios and compared to static sampling strategies. We observed through experimentation that the pinpoint of performance anomalies, supported by the data collected using the adaptive profiling algorithms, stills timely as with full-profiling while the response time overhead is reduced in almost 60%. When compared to a non-profiled version the response time overhead is less than 1.5%.

Cloud adaptation aims to provide the cloud infrastructure with the necessary computational resources to meet the agreed SLAs and, simultaneously, optimize the resources usage.

Autonomic computing is presented as the alternative to cope with the growing complexity. It is a holistic approach, in which the systems are able to configure, heal, optimize, and protect by themselves. Web-based applications are an example of systems where the complexity is high. The number of components, their interoperability, and workload variations are factors that may lead to performance failures or unavailability scenarios. The occurrence of these scenarios affects the revenue and reputation of businesses that rely on these types of applications.

In this article, we present a self-healing framework for Web-based applications (SHõWA). SHõWA is composed by several modules, which monitor the application, analyze the data to detect and pinpoint anomalies, and execute recovery actions autonomously. The monitoring is done by a small aspect-oriented programming agent. This agent does not require changes to the application source code and includes adaptive and selective algorithms to regulate the level of monitoring. The anomalies are detected and pinpointed by means of statistical correlation. The data analysis detects changes in the server response time and analyzes if those changes are correlated with the workload or are due to a performance anomaly. In the presence of performance anomalies, the data analysis pinpoints the anomaly. Upon the pinpointing of anomalies, SHõWA executes a recovery procedure. We also present a study about the detection and localization of anomalies, the accuracy of the data analysis, and the performance impact induced by SHõWA. Two benchmarking applications, exercised through dynamic workloads, and different types of anomaly were considered in the study. The results reveal that (1) the capacity of SHõWA to detect and pinpoint anomalies while the number of end users affected is low; (2) SHõWA was able to detect anomalies without raising any false alarm; and (3) SHõWA does not induce a significant performance overhead (throughput was affected in less than 1%, and the response time delay was no more than 2 milliseconds).","self-healing, reliability, performance, Self-healing, autonomic computing, Web applications, fault tolerance",,2015-03-01,2015,3,N,"Joao Paulo Magalhaes",jpfm@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2454_hpim1359.jpg,1977-01-03,jpfm,4

where nodes share all the checkpoints they compute. Cliques function as sur- 
vivable units, where checkpoints and tasks are not lost as long as one of the 
nodes of the clique remains alive. To simplify construction and maintenance of

This question may not be an issue in the context of robustness testing aimed at the identification of weaknesses in software components. However, the use of interface faults by API parameter corruption as a general approach for dependability evaluation in component-based systems requires an in depth study of interface faults and a close observation of the way internal component faults propagate to the component interfaces. In this work we present the results of experimental evaluation of realistic component-based applications developed in Java and C using the injection of interface faults by API parameter corruption and the injection of software faults inside the components by modification of the target code. The faults injected inside software components emulate typical programming errors and are based on an extensive field data study previously published.

Obviously, the same confidence and quality of the custom made software components is expected from the commercial applications. In most cases, such products (COTS) are not designed with stringent timing and/or safety requirements as priorities. Thus, to decrease the gap between the use of custom made components and COTS components, this paper presents a methodology for evaluating COTS products in the scope of dependable, real time systems, through the application of fault injection techniques at key points of the software engineering process. By combining the use of robustness testing (fault injection at interface level) with software fault injection (using educated fault injection operators), a COTS component can be assessed in the context of the system it will belong to, with special emphasis given to timing and safety constraints that are usually imposed by the target real time dependable environment. In the course of this work, three case studies have been performed to assess the methodology using realistic scenarios that used common COTS products.","Verification and validation",,2007-02-26,2007,1,U,"Nuno Silva",nsilva@criticalsoftware.com,NULL,NULL,,4

São crescentemente um factor crítico de sucesso para as organizações, dada a sua importância na disponibilização de informação e distribuição de dados. Muitos sistemas são construídos tendo como suporte uma arquitectura baseada em web services compostos. A composição de web services refere-se à utilização orquestrada de diversos web services que funcionam conjuntamente para o fornecimento de um serviço mais abrangente. O termo ‘processo de negócio’ é utilizado correntemente como sinónimo deste conceito. Dado existir uma dependência entre os elementos de uma composição, facilmente se percebe que uma falha num dos elementos pode afectar a disponibilidade de toda a composição. De um modo análogo, o desempenho individual de cada componente tem reflexo no desempenho global da composição.
A tolerância a falhas é um tópico de investigação bastante actual. Uma das soluções usuais aplicada para aumentar a tolerância a falhas de hardware é a de replicação de componentes. Apesar disto, o problema subsiste a nível do software utilizado, dado que uma mesma versão continua a existir nas múltiplas instâncias de um sistema. Uma das abordagens a este problema passa pela utilização de versões diferentes de um mesmo elemento para a detecção e tolerância a falhas.
Apesar disto, o suporte à composição de serviços é pobre no fornecimento de soluções para o reconhecimento e selecção de web services alternativos. De facto, não há formas padronizadas ou prácticas para escolha que permitam uma melhoria posterior no desempenho e confiabilidade de um processo de negócio.
O objectivo do trabalho apresentado nesta dissertação passa pela avaliação e comparação do desempenho e confiabilidade de web services em várias vertentes (robustez, recuperação, etc.). Adicionalmente, é também um dos focos deste trabalho a investigação de novos modos de uso da diversidade em termos da melhoria das propriedades de autonomia de serviços compostos.

However, building representative test cases is quite difficult and developers often miss the test cases for robustness validation. This paper demonstrates how robustness testing can be integrated in the test driven development process to improve web services robustness. To demonstrate the proposed approach we have invited experienced developers to implement three different versions of the web services specified by the standard TPC-App performance benchmark, two following the standard test-driven development process and the other using the approach proposed in this paper.

However, field studies show that a large number of web services are deployed with security flaws (e.g., having SQL Injection vulnerabilities). Although several techniques for the identification of security vulnerabilities have been proposed, developing non-vulnerable web services is still a difficult task. In fact, security-related concerns are hard to apply as they involve adding complexity to already complex code. This paper proposes an approach to secure web services against SQL and XPath Injection attacks, by transparently detecting and aborting service invocations that try to take advantage of potential vulnerabilities. Our mechanism was applied to secure several web services specified by the TPC-App benchmark, showing to be 100% effective in stopping attacks, non-intrusive and very easy to use.","Web Services Security","web services, SQL/XPath Injection",2009-08-31,2009,1,Y,"Nuno Laranjeiro",cnl@dei.uc.pt,2466_,1977-02-10,cnl,4

Although there are tools that allow testing Web applications against security vulnerabilities, previous research shows that the effectiveness of those tools in Web services environments is very poor. In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.

In a SOA environment providers supply a set of services that must be robust. Although SOA is being used in business-critical environments, there is no practical means to measure or compare the robustness of services. Robustness failures in such environments are dangerous, as they can be maliciously exploited with severe consequences for the attacked systems. This chapter addresses the problem of robustness validation in SOA environments. The approach proposed is based on a set of robustness tests that is used to discover both programming and design errors. Two concrete examples are presented: one focusing on web services and the other targeting Java Message Service (JMS) middleware. The proposed approach is useful for both providers (to validate the robustness of deployed services) and consumers (to select the services that best fit architectural requirements).","Web services robustness","Service Oriented Architectures, robustness testing",2009-10-27,2009,5,Y,"Nuno Laranjeiro",cnl@dei.uc.pt,2466_,1977-02-10,cnl,4

However, when executing robustness tests, a very large amount of service responses has to be manually classified to distinguish regular responses from responses that indicate robustness problems. Besides requiring a large amount of time and effort, this complex classification process can easily lead to errors resulting from the human intervention in such a laborious task. Text classification algorithms have been applied successfully in many contexts (e.g., spam identification, text categorization, etc) and are considered a powerful tool for the successful automation of several classification-based tasks. In this paper we present a study on the applicability of five widely used text classification algorithms in the context of web services robustness testing. In practice, we assess the effectiveness of Support Vector Ma-chines, Naïve Bayes, Large Linear Classification, K-nearest neighbor (Ibk), and Hyperpipes in classifying web services responses. Results indicate that these algorithms can be effec-tively used to automate the identification of robustness issues while reducing human intervention.

After testing a set of services, there is typically a very large quantity and variety of test results to be analyzed, which poses a challenge to the developer that has to manually process all results and identify the outputs that indicate the presence of bugs in the code. Previous research indicates that well-known automatic classification algorithms can be used to automate this step. However, the applicability of such algorithms is also limited, as they are frequently unable to deal with the large diversity of outputs present in typical WS scenarios, thus producing incorrect results. In this paper we propose an approach that allows the automatic classification of the results of WS robustness tests. The technique integrates rule-based classification (including domain rules) and conventional machine-learning algorithms trained using generic data. The proposed approach was used to classify a large set of results of tests performed over publicly available WS and also over in-house implementations of several TPC benchmarks. Results show the effectiveness of the technique, indicating that it can be integrated in the robustness testing procedure, enabling, in this way, the delivery of a full end-to-end automatic approach for WSs robustness testing.","Web services robustness classification","web services, robustness classification",2011-07-04,2011,1,Y,"Nuno Laranjeiro",cnl@dei.uc.pt,2466_,1977-02-10,cnl,4

Research indicates that, in many cases, services are deployed with robustness issues (i.e., displaying unexpected behaviors when in presence of invalid input conditions). Recently, Test-Driven Development (TDD) emerged as software development technique based on test cases that are defined before development, as a way to validate functionalities. However, programmers typically disregard the verification of limit conditions, such as the ones targeted by robustness testing. Moreover, in TDD, tests are created before developing the functionality, conflicting with the typical robustness testing approach. This chapter discusses the integration of robustness testing in TDD for improving the robustness of web services during development. We have requested three programmers to create a set of services based on open-source code and to implement different versions of the services specified by TPC-App, using both TDD and the approach presented in this chapter.

In this paper we address the fol- lowing question: could we provide a meaningful taxonomy of reliable request-response protocols? We generate valid sequences of client and server actions, organize the generated sequences into a prefix tree, and classify them according to their reliability semantics and memory requirements. The tree reveals three families of protocols matching common real-world implementations that try to deliver exactly-once or at-most-once. The strict organization of the protocols provides a solid foundation for creating correct services, and we show that it also serves to easily identify fallacies and pitfalls of existing implementations.","Reliable Distributed Communication","Reliability, Exactly-Once, At-Most-Once, Taxonomy",0000-00-00,2015,1,Y,"Nuno Laranjeiro",cnl@dei.uc.pt,2466_,1977-02-10,cnl,4

Despite the growing importance, HTTP-based applications are quite exposed to network failures, which can bring in huge losses to the service users and providers, including financial and reputation losses. Several approaches try to achieve reliable communication by using logging and retransmission of whole HTTP messages, which is especially ill-adapted to large messages. Stream-based approaches are more efficient as, upon failure, they transparently resume data transmission from where it stopped. Despite this, designing a stream-based mechanism involves significant challenges, as it is very difficult to know how much data is lost due to failure. In this paper we propose a stream-based mechanism for reliable HTTP communication that is entirely based on HTTP messages and is compatible with existing software. The mechanism is presented as a design pattern and relieves developers from explicitly handling connection failures, providing a standard way for building more reliable applications. Results show that the mechanism is functional, compatible with legacy applications, and that the coding and runtime costs of this design pattern are quite low.

high quality test data. The focus of this work is on presenting a searchbased
approach for the the unit-testing of third-party object-oriented Java
software.
Test cases are represented and evolved using the Strongly Typed Genetic
Programming paradigm, which effectively mimics the inheritance and polymorphic
properties of object-oriented programs and enables the maintenance
of call dependences when applying tree construction, mutation or crossover.
Our strategy for evaluating the quality of test cases includes instrumenting
the test object for basic block analysis and structural event dispatch,
and executing the instrumented test object using the generated test cases as
'inputsâ? ' in order to collect trace information and derive coverage metrics.
Static analysis, instrumentation and execution tracing is performed solely
with basis on the high-level information extracted from the Java Bytecode of
the test object. Given that the test object's source code is often unavailable,
working at the Bytecode level allows broadening the scope of applicability of
our approach; it can be used, for instance, to perform structural testing on
third-party Java components.
Test objects are represented internally by weighted control-flow graphs;
strategies are introduced for favouring test cases that exercise problematic
structures and difficult control-flow paths, which involve dynamic weight
reevaluation. The aim is that of efficiently guiding the search process towards
achieving full structural coverage ' which often involves promoting
the definition of complex and intricate test cases that define elaborate state

3165,2470,"Contributions for Improving Genetic Programming-Based Approaches to the Evolutionary Testing of Object-Oriented Software","Software Testing is the process of exercising an application to detect errors and to verify that it satisfies the specified requirements. It is an expensive process, typically consuming roughly half of the total costs involved in software development; automating Test Data generation is thus vital to advance the state-of-the-art in Software Testing. The application of Evolutionary Algorithms to Test Data generation is often referred to as Evolutionary Testing. The goal of Evolutionary Testing is to find a set of Test Programs which satisfies a particular test criterion. The focus of this work was put on developing a Genetic Programming-based solution for evolving Test Data for the structural Unit Testing of Object-Oriented programs.

The technical approach to Object-Oriented Evolutionary Testing proposed involves representing Test Programs using the Strongly-Typed Genetic Programming paradigm. Test Program quality evaluation includes instrumenting the Test Object, and executing it using the generated Test Programs with the intention of collecting trace information with which to derive coverage metrics. The aim is that of efficiently guiding the search process towards achieving full structural coverage of the program under test.

The foremost objectives of this work were those of defining strategies for addressing the challenges posed by the Object-Oriented paradigm, and of proposing methodologies for enhancing the efficiency and the effectiveness of search-based approaches to Software Testing. 

Relevant contributions include: the introduction of a novel strategy for Test Program evaluation and search guidance; 
the presentation of an Input Domain Reduction methodology based on the concept of Purity Analysis; suggesting an adaptive methodology for promoting the introduction of relevant instructions into the generated Test Programs by means of Mutation; and the proposal of an Object Reuse methodology for Genetic Programming-based approaches to Evolutionary Testing, which allows a single object instance to be used as a method parameter multiple times.

This is particularly evident when we discuss the maintainability of Object-Oriented (OO) systems which, due to their specific characteristics, hide information that cannot be gathered through static analysis. As maintainability can be defined as the ""speed and ease with which a program can be corrected or changed"", we believe that test data are reflective of the changes performed during maintenance. Moreover, empirical observations allow to speculate about the relationships between maintainability and the behaviour of the software when executed by test cases (e.g., coverage values) and the test cases' characteristics (e.g., generation time). Our aim is to complement the state-of-the art by proposing a new approach for understanding and characterizing the maintainability of OO systems, which makes use of test data and of the information gathered from the tests' execution.","Software Engineering","Complexity theory,Correlation,Measurement,Ontologies,Software;Standards,Testing,Software Maintenance,Software Quality,Software Testing",2014-09-26,2014,1,Y,"José Carlos Bregieiro Ribeiro",jose.ribeiro@ipleiria.pt,1357752014_jribeiro.jpg,1981-01-10,jribeiro,4

1841,2601,"A Framework for Performance Evaluation of Complex Event Processing Systems (poster)","Several new Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines have been recently released, many of which are intended to be used in performance sensitive scenarios - like fraud detection, traffic control, or health care systems. However, there is no standard means to assess the performance of a CEP engine. This omission is all the more relevant as there are currently many competing products, languages, architectures, data models, and data processing CEP techniques. A performance evaluation framework can help identify good design decisions and assist in improving engines. Here we demonstrate our work in progress: FINCoS, a framework that can be used to benchmark CEP systems. The proposed framework has five relevant characteristics: 
i.	Flexible (e.g., it allows changing the workload on the fly to measure reactions to peak loads);
ii.	Independent of particular workloads;
iii.	Neutral (not bound to any specific CEP product); 
iv.	Correctness check (validators can be plugged into the framework on demand to verify results);
v.	Scalable (many of its components, like event generators, can be centrally orchestrated and run in parallel).

Note that the framework does not include a benchmark specification. In fact, it was designed such that diverse datasets and query scenarios can be easily attached and tested on several CEP engines.

As such, this framework has three key benefits: first, it can be used by the CEP community to more quickly devise and experiment new benchmarks for event processing systems. Second, CEP vendors can employ the framework in conjunction with their own test datasets to benchmark their systems internally. Finally, customers can use it with their real data and select the CEP engine that best fits their needs.",,,2008-07-01,2008,1,U,"Marcelo Rodrigues Nunes Mendes",mnunes@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2601_,1984-04-12,mnunes,4

What are the performance bottlenecks? Will perfor-mance degrade gracefully with increasing loads? In this paper we make a first attempt to answer these questions by running several micro-benchmarks on three different engines, while we vary query parameters like window size, win-dow expiration type, predicate selectivity, and data values. We also perform some experiments to assess engines scalability with respect to number of que-ries and propose ways for evaluating their ability in adapting to changes in load conditions. Lastly, we show that similar queries have widely different perfor-mances on the same or different engines and that no engine dominates the other two in all scenarios.","Complex Event Processing",,2009-08-01,2009,1,U,"Marcelo Rodrigues Nunes Mendes",mnunes@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2601_,1984-04-12,mnunes,4

3449,2601,"Overcoming Memory Limitations in High-Throughput Event-Based Applications","The last decade has witnessed the emergence of business critical applications processing streaming data for domains as diverse as credit card fraud detection, real-time recommendation systems, call-center monitoring, ad selection, network monitoring, and more. Most of those applications need to compute hundreds or thousands of metrics continuously while coping with very high event input rates. As a consequence, large amounts of state (i.e., moving windows) need to be maintained, very often exceeding the available memory resources. Nonetheless, current event processing platforms have little or no memory management capabilities, hanging or simply crashing when memory is exhausted. In this paper we report our experience in using secondary storage for solving the performance problems of memory-constrained event processing applications. For that, we propose SlideM, a novel buffer management algorithm that exploits the access pattern of sliding windows in order to efficiently handle memory shortages. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a real stream processing engine and validated through an extensive experimental performance evaluation. Results corroborate the efficacy of the approach: the system was able to sustain very high input rates (up to 300,000 events per second) for very large windows (about 30GB) while consuming small amounts of main memory (few kilobytes).","Performance of Event Processing Systems","Disk, Event Stream Processing, Memory Management, Query Plan Sharing, Sliding Window",2013-04-24,2013,1,U,"Marcelo Rodrigues Nunes Mendes",mnunes@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2601_,1984-04-12,mnunes,4

In this paper, we present our work in progress: the BiCEP benchmark suite, a set of workloads, datasets and tools for evaluating different performance aspects of event processing platforms.

However, the effectiveness of those mechanisms is very dependent on the actual configuration chosen by the database administrator. Tuning a large database is quite complex and achieving high security is a very difficult task that requires a lot of expertise and continuous and proactive work. In this paper we present an assessment tool aimed at evaluating the security of DBMS configurations. The proposed tool is simple and effective, and can be used by administrators with very little security knowledge.

2670,2762,"libboincexec: A generic virtualization approach for the BOINC middleware","BOINC is a client-server desktop grid middleware that has grown to power very large computational projects. BOINC clients request computing jobs to a central server and run them alongside other regular applications. Unfortunately, this kind of execution causes two kinds of problems. Firstly, developers must port their application to every single operating system target, which usually means maintaining several different versions of the same application. Secondly, any application running natively on desktop grid hardware is a potential security threat to the volunteer client.\\
During the course of this research we sought an efficient and generic method for alternative execution of jobs in BOINC clients. Our approach is strongly guided by the principles of non-intrusiveness and contains two main components. The first is a library, libboincexec, which is able to control several virtual machines monitors. The second is a modified BOINC wrapper that provides the glue between libboincexec and the middleware.\\
Through the use of this solution we are able to effectively use virtual machines to perform computation on desktop grids. This computation is inherently safe because virtual machines provide sandboxing. Additionally, by targeting the same virtual operating system, the problem of maintaining different versions of an application does not exist, thereby solving the heterogeneity problem of desktop grid nodes.","Grid Computing","boinc; desktop grids; virtualization; sandboxing;",2011-05-20,2011,1,Y,"Diogo Ferreira",defer@student.dei.uc.pt,NULL,NULL,,4

As networks expand and organizations start to federate access to their resources, authorization infrastructures become increasingly difficult to manage. In this paper, we explore the automatic adaptation of authorization assets (policies and subject access rights) in order to manage federated authorization infrastructures. We demonstrate adaptation through a Self-Adaptive Authorization Framework (SAAF) controller that is capable of managing policy based federated role/attribute access control authorization infrastructures. The SAAF controller implements a feedback loop to monitor the authorization infrastructure in terms of authorization assets and subject behavior, analyze potential adaptations for handling malicious behavior, and act upon authorization assets to control future authorization decisions. We evaluate a prototype of the SAAF controller by simulating malicious behavior within a deployed federated authorization infrastructure (federation), demonstrating the escalation of adaptation, along with a comparison of SAAF to current technology.",,"Self-adaptation, Authorization, Policy management, Identity management, Autonomic security, RBAC, ABAC, SAML, PERMIS",2014-01-11,2014,3,Y,"Rogério de Lemos",r.delemos@kent.ac.uk,1351680418_rogerio.jpg,1975-01-01,rdelemos,4

To this end, we compare the results of resilience evaluation between the original version of the middleware, in which adaptation mechanisms are embedded at the code-level, and a modified version of that middleware in which the adaptation mechanisms are implemented using Rainbow, a framework for architecture-based self-adaptation.

The contribution of this paper is the generation, transformation and verification of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) models at run-time, as a means for providing assurances that the adaptations to be deployed are valid. The goal is to protect the system against insider threats by adapting at run-time the access control policies associated with system resources, and access rights assigned to users. Depending on the type of attack, and based on the models from the target system and its environment, the adapted access control models need to be evaluated against the RBAC metamodel, and the adaptation constraints related to the application.

2058,2786,"Effective Detection of SQL/XPath Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services","This paper proposes a new automatic approach for the detection of SQL Injection and XPath Injection vulnerabilities, two of the most common and most critical types of vulnerabilities in Web services. Although there are tools that allow testing Web applications against security vulnerabilities, previous research shows that the effectiveness of those tools in Web services environments is very poor. In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.

2068,2786,"Using Web Security Scanners to Detect Vulnerabilities in Web Services","Although Web services are becoming business-critical components, they are often deployed with critical software bugs that can be maliciously explored. Web vulnerability scanners allow detecting security vulnerabilities in Web services by stressing the service from the point of view of an attacker. However, research and practice show that different scanners have different performance on vulnerabilities detection. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of security vulnerabilities in 300 publicly available Web services. Four well known vulnerability scanners have been used to identify security flaws in Web services implementations. A large number of vulnerabilities has been observed, which confirms that many services are deployed without proper security testing. Additionally, the differences in the vulnerabilities detected and the high number of false-positives (35% and 40% in two cases) and low coverage (less than 20% for two of the scanners) observed highlight the limitations of Web vulnerability scanners on detecting security vulnerabilities in Web services.

2096,2786,"Comparing the Effectiveness of Penetration Testing and Static Code Analysis on the Detection of SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services","Web services are becoming business-critical components that must provide a non-vulnerable interface to the client applications. However, previous research and practice show that many web services are deployed with critical vulnerabilities. SQL injection vulnerabilities are particularly relevant, as Web services frequently access a relational database using SQL commands. Penetration testing and static code analysis are two well-know techniques often used for the detection of security vulnerabilities. In this work we compare how effective these two techniques are on the detection of SQL injection vulnerabilities in Web services code. To understand the strengths and limitations of these techniques, we used several commercial and open source tools to detect vulnerabilities in a set of vulnerable services. Results suggest that, in general, static code analyzers are able to detect more SQL injection vulnerabilities than penetration testing tools. Another key observation is that tools implementing the same detection approach frequently detect different vulnerabilities. Finally, many tools provide a low coverage and a high false positives rate, making them a bad option for programmers.

2113,2786,"Evaluating Web Services Security","Although web services are becoming business-critical components, they are often deployed with critical software bugs, causing security vulnerabilities that can be maliciously exploited. Develop time constraints and developers not specialized in security often lead to security cautions being disregarded, giving utmost importance to t the use of automated security testing tools to detect existing security vulnerabilities. However, automated security testing tools often do not deserve the confidence that developing teams put on them. In fact, previous research shows that many vulnerabilities remain undetected even when using well-known and widely used vulnerability detection tools.
The present work has two main contributions: the evaluation of existing tools and the proposal of new approaches for the detection of vulnerabilities. First we evaluate existing tools to assess their effectiveness in the detection of vulnerabilities in web services environments. Results show that many web services are deployed with security vulnerabilities (being SQL Injection the most common type of vulnerability in this context) and that security test tools present an unsatisfactory effectiveness in web services environment (low coverage and high number of false positives). This way, we propose two new techniques for detection of security vulnerabilities in web services. The first is based on penetration testing and target SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The second is a gray-box approach for the detection of SQL Injection and XPath Injection vulnerabilities.
The experimental evaluation shown that the penetration testing tool achieved higher effectiveness than the web security scanners on detecting SQL Injection vulnerabilities, showing that is possible to develop a vulnerability scanner for web services that performs much better than the commercial ones currently available. In relation to the proposed gray-box approach, experimental evaluation has shown that it performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.","Web Services Security","Web Services, Security, Service Oriented Architecture, Software testing, SQL Injection, XPath Injection, Software vulnerabilities, Vulnerability detection, Dependability, black-box testing, gray-box testing.",2009-07-23,2009,7,Y,"Nuno Antunes",nmsa@dei.uc.pt,1382143885_20120920-20130211-institutional-photo-cv-4x5.jpg,1985-10-18,nmsa,4
2366,2786,"Benchmarking Vulnerability Detection Tools for Web Services","Vulnerability detection tools are frequently considered the silver-bullet for detecting vulnerabilities in web services. However, research shows that the effectiveness of most of those tools is very low and that using the wrong tool may lead to the deployment of services with undetected vulnerabilities. In this paper we propose a benchmarking approach to assess and compare the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools in web services environments. This approach was used to define a concrete benchmark for SQL Injection vulnerability detection tools. This benchmark is demonstrated by a real example of benchmarking several widely used tools, including four penetration-testers, three static code analyzers, and one anomaly detector. Results show that the benchmark accurately portrays the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools and suggest that the proposed approach can be applied in the field.

2599,2786,"Enhancing Penetration Testing with Attack Signatures and Interface Monitoring for the Detection of Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services","Web services are often deployed with critical software bugs that may be maliciously exploited. Developers often trust on penetration testing tools to detect those vulnerabilities but the effectiveness of such technique is limited by the lack of information on the internal state of the tested services. This paper proposes a new approach for the detection of injection vulnerabilities in web services. The approach uses attack signa-tures and interface monitoring to increase the visibility of the penetration testing process, yet without needing to access web service?s internals (as these are frequently not available). To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach we implemented a prototype tool to detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities in SOAP. An experimental evaluation comparing this prototype with three commercial penetration testers was conducted. Results show that our prototype is able to achieve much higher detec-tion coverage than those testers while avoiding false positives, indicating that the proposed approach can be used in real de-velopment scenarios.","Web Services Security","web-services, security, vulnerability detection, attack signatures, penetration testing, interface monitoring,",2011-07-04,2011,1,Y,"Nuno Antunes",nmsa@dei.uc.pt,1382143885_20120920-20130211-institutional-photo-cv-4x5.jpg,1985-10-18,nmsa,4

In fact, the lack of information on the internal state of the tested services and the complexity and variability of the responses analyzed, limits the effectiveness of such technique, highlighting the importance of evaluating and improving existing tools. The goal of this paper is to investigate if attack signatures and interface monitoring can be an effective mean to assess and improve the perfor-mance of penetration testing tools in web services environ-ments. In practice, attacks performed by such tools are signed and the interfaces between the target application and external resources are monitored (e.g., between services and a database server), allowing gathering additional information on existing vulnerabilities. A prototype was implemented focusing on SQL injection vulnerabilities. The experimental evaluation results clearly show that the proposed approach can be used in real scenarios.","Vulnerability Detection in Web Services","web-services, security, vulnerability detection, attack signatures, penetration testing, interface monitoring",2012-11-30,2012,1,Y,"Nuno Antunes",nmsa@dei.uc.pt,1382143885_20120920-20130211-institutional-photo-cv-4x5.jpg,1985-10-18,nmsa,4

Robustness is defined as the degree to which a system operates correctly in the presence of exceptional inputs or stressful environmental conditions. As triggering robustness faults could in the worst case scenario even crash the system, detecting this type of faults is of utmost importance. This chapter presents the state of the art on robustness testing by summarizing the evolution of basic robustness testing techniques, giving an overview of the specific methods and tools developed for major application domains, and introducing penetration testing, a specialization of robustness testing, which searches for security vulnerabilities. Finally, the use of testing results in resilience modelling and analysis is discussed.

Modern intrusion detection systems (IDSes) for virtualized environments are deployed in the virtualization layer with components inside the virtual machine monitor (VMM) and the trusted host virtual machine (VM). Such IDSes can monitor at the same time the network and host activities of all guest VMs running on top of a VMM being isolated from malicious users of these VMs. We refer to IDSes for virtualized environments as VMM-based IDSes. In this work, we analyze state-of-the-art intrusion detection techniques applied in virtualized environments and architectures of VMM-based IDSes. Further, we identify challenges that apply specifically to benchmarking VMM-based IDSes focusing on workloads and metrics. For example, we discuss the challenge of defining representative baseline benign workload profiles as well as the challenge of defining malicious workloads containing attacks targeted at the VMM. We also discuss the impact of on-demand resource provisioning features of virtualized environments (e.g., CPU and memory hot plugging, memory ballooning) on IDS benchmarking measures such as capacity and attack detection accuracy. Finally, we outline future research directions in the area of benchmarking VMM-based IDSes and of intrusion detection in virtualized environments in general.

Modern virtualized service infrastructures expose attack vectors that enable attacks of high severity, such as attacks targeting hypervisors. A malicious user of a guest VM (virtual machine) may execute an attack against the underlying hypervisor via hypercalls, which are software traps from a kernel of a fully or partially paravirtualized guest VM to the hypervisor. The exploitation of a vulnerability of a hypercall handler may have severe consequences such as altering hypervisor’s memory, which may result in the execution of malicious code with hypervisor privilege. Despite the importance of vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers, there is not much publicly available information on them. This significantly hinders advances towards securing hypercall interfaces. In this work, we provide in-depth technical information on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers. Our vulnerability analysis is based on reverse engineering the released patches fixing the considered vulnerabilities. For each analyzed vulnerability, we provide background information essential for understanding the vulnerability, and information on the vulnerable hypercall handler and the error causing the vulnerability. We also show how the vulnerability can be triggered and discuss the state of the targeted hypervisor after the vulnerability has been triggered.

These tasks commonly execute on a fraction of the nodes of a larger cluster, and it is left to users to make best guesses on the number of nodes needed for a task to complete within acceptable time. Nonetheless, the time a task will take to complete is often unknown beforehand. Previous research addressed this problem by establishing time constraints for query execution and, when needed, reduce the accuracy of queries using result approximation and/or sampling. However in many situations reduced accuracy is not tolerable. In this paper we present FloodDQ, a MapReduce system that implements deadline queries?queries that must finish before a deadline, never discarding data or reducing accuracy. FloodDQ produces timely, accurate results by adaptively increasing or decreasing computing power, at runtime, towards completing execution within the specified deadline. In FloodDQ, users only specify a deadline and the input data. The system monitors the progress of the task and extrapolates whether it will complete on time. If the task is deemed to complete after the specified time, the system requests more nodes from an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider, and adds them to the computation. On the other hand, if the task is deemed to complete before the specified time the system quiesces and releases surplus nodes, cutting costs to a minimum.

2673,2822,"Flood: Elastic Streaming MapReduce","Distributed data stream processing (DSP) is used to analyze information and raise alarms in business-critical scenarios such as financial fraud-detection, clickstream processing, network security, traffic control, or real-time KPI computations. Processing this information efficiently is very challenging because the nature of continuous streaming sources is varying in nature: often the amount of data and processing changes with time of day and day of week and frequently has unexpected spikes. Thus, the result is that most DSP computations are either over-provisioned, introducing increased cost and wasted energy, or are under- provisioned and, either incur in performance degradation or denial-of-service, or have to resort to load shedding.
We demonstrate Flood, a scalable, elastic DSP engine that solves these problems. By using a scalable computing model, MapReduce, and adequately monitoring running computations our system is able to decide, in runtime, if there is a lack or a waste of resources. Flood then acts autonomically by requesting or releasing computing nodes, immediately expanding or contracting the computation, making sure that latency and throughput requirements are guaranteed. This leads to augmented efficiency and lowered costs, all while insuring quality of service.","Distributed Systems","Distributed Stream Processing, Elastic, Scalability",2010-07-01,2010,1,U,"David Alves",dalves@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2822_foto_social.jpg,1975-01-01,dalves,4

Due to the real-time characteristic of video-streaming, very low failure detection and recovery delays are required. Proactive recovery in face of performance degradation is a prominent area to explore. Current performance analysis work in video-streaming focuses mostly on capacity planning and session admission through complex workload and resource modeling. These models have limited application when degradation is not explained by client workload (e.g., dynamic resource reallocation, software faults and misconfiguration). We explore server-side monitoring of performance degradations in video-streaming servers, based on statistical analysis of server metrics and client-server interaction messages. Statistical analysis of event logs show that analyzed metrics can be used as symptoms of failures to anticipate them and thus enabling proactive recovery. Exception is server overloading caused by streaming of unpopular videos, which are exposed by metrics when QoS degradation is close to accepted quality thresholds.","Failure Prediction in Streaming Servers","Failure Prediction, Video-Streaming",2011-02-15,2011,1,Y,"Carlos Cunha",ccunha@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2823_,1975-01-01,ccunha,4

Service parameters addressing quality and continuity of video content have a special importance due to the human sensitiveness to variations on video quality and decades of quality patterns absorbed by traditional TV users. Thus, the performance analysis and repair lifecycle at server and network levels is mandatory to avoid degradation of user experience. At the network level, there are several effective techniques based on temporal and spatial data redundancy, though they deeply depend on healthy servers with enough resources to afford both the client and recovery workloads. Excess of streaming workloads and performance anomalies (i.e., server resources exhaustion not explained by client requests) are typical causes of server performance failures. The former is often caused by memory caching of popular videos, which impacts the number of requests accepted by the server and consequently blurs load admittance mechanisms when the workload changes. The latter is caused by server internal factors independent of client workloads (e.g., memory leaks and maintenance activities). Separating client workload related failures from performance anomalies is mandatory for selection of immediate repair actions, capacity planning and to support fault repair. We evaluated the performance of Naive Bayes and C4.5 Trees algorithms for classification of these failure states using client and server performance metrics. Results shown that it is possible to predict the type of failure with levels of recall and accuracy higher than 90% for workload types with different popularity levels.","Failure Prediction and Diagnosis in Streaming Servers","Failure Prediction, Failure Diagnosis, Video-Streaming",2012-05-13,2012,1,Y,"Carlos Cunha",ccunha@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2823_,1975-01-01,ccunha,4

Tyche has a small $128$-bit state and an expected period length of $2^{127}$. Unlike most nonlinear generators, Tyche is consistently fast across architectures, due to its very simple iteration function derived from ChaCha, one of today's fastest stream ciphers.

Tyche is especially amenable for the highly parallel environments we find today, in particular for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), where it enables a very large number of uncorrelated parallel streams running independently. For example, $2^{16}$ parallel independent streams are expected to generate about $2^{96}$ pseudorandom numbers each, without overlaps.

Additionally, we determine bounds for the period length and parallelism of our generators, and evaluate their statistical quality and performance. We compare Tyche and the variant Tyche-i to the XORWOW and TEA$_8$ generators in CPUs and GPUs.

However, this same consolidation exposes core services of the infrastructure to very disruptive attacks. This is indeed the case with monitoring, which needs to be dependable and secure to ensure proper operation of large datacenters and cloud infrastructures. We argue that currently existing centralized monitoring approaches (e.g., relying on a single solution provider, using single point of failure components) represent a huge risk, because a single vulnerability may compromise the entire monitoring infrastructure.

In this paper, we describe the TRONE approach to trustworthy monitoring, which relies on multiple components to achieve increased levels of reliance on the monitoring data and hence increased trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the TRONE framework for event dissemination, on security-oriented diagnosis based on collected events and on fast network adaptation in critical situations based on multi-homing application support.

On the other hand there are software development kits that require a significant effort from the developer to ensure the program is adequately obfuscated.

In this paper, we present obfuscation methods that are easily integrated into the development chain of C++ programs, by using the compiler itself to perform the obfuscated code generation. This is accomplished by using advanced C++ techniques, such as operator overloading, template metaprogramming, expression templates, and more.

In their original form, however, these attacks only affect elliptic curve implementations using addition and doubling formulas that are independent of at least one of the curve parameters. This property is typically satisfied for elliptic curves in Weierstrass form but not for newer models that have gained increasing popularity in recent years, like Edwards and twisted Edwards curves. It has therefore been suggested (e.g. in the original paper on invalid curve attacks) that such alternate models could protect against those attacks.

In this paper, we dispel that belief and present the first attack of this nature against (twisted) Edwards curves, Jacobi quartics, Jacobi intersections and more. Our attack differs from invalid curve attacks proper in that the cryptographic device is tricked into carrying out a computation not on another elliptic curve, but on a group isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the underlying base field. This often makes it easy to recover the secret scalar with a single invalid computation.

3722,2825,"A Fault-Tolerant Session Layer with Reliable One-Way Messaging and Server Migration Facility","Despite being extremely successful, TCP has a number of shortcomings when network disruptions occur, or when peers do not follow a request-reply interaction: it does not handle connection crashes, event-driven communication or application migration. In many cases, programmers must engineer their own solutions to write reliable distributed applications.
To overcome these limitations, we propose FTSL, a Fault- Tolerant Session Layer that works on top of TCP. Besides offering a full-duplex connection, FTSL owns a number of distinctive features: it tolerates TCP connection crashes, it provides highly decoupled reliable patterns for one-way communication, and it enables server-side migration. While the first two greatly simplify distributed systems programming for a wide range of applications, the latter enables cloud systems managers to move a server application for load balance or maintenance, without moving the entire virtual machine. We present the FTSL protocol, its implementation, and resort to performance to show that FTSL imposes a reasonable overhead for the guarantees it provides.","Reliable Distributed Communication","Fault Tolerance, Application Migration, One- Way Messaging, TCP, Session Layer",0000-00-00,2014,1,Y,"Naghmeh Ramezani Ivaki",naghmeh@dei.uc.pt,2825_,1983-09-20,naghmeh,4

When the network fails, developers must rollback the application to some coherent state on their own using error-prone solutions. Overcoming this limitation is, therefore, a deeply investigated and challenging problem. Existing solutions range from transport-layer to application-layer protocols, including additions to TCP, usually transparent to the application. None of these solutions is perfect for the task, because they all impact TCP's simplicity, performance or ubiquity, if not all.

To avoid these shortcomings, we contain TCP connection crashes inside a single session layer exposed as a sockets interface. Based on this interface, we create a blocking and a non-blocking fault-tolerant design pattern. We explore the blocking design in an open source File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and perform a thorough evaluation of performance, complexity and overhead of both designs. Our results show that using one of the patterns to tolerate TCP connection crashes, in new or existing applications, involves a very limited effort and negligible penalties.","Fault-Tolerance in Distributed Systems","TCP, Connection Failure, Fault-Tolerance, Session Layer, Design Pattern",2014-12-16,2014,1,Y,"Naghmeh Ramezani Ivaki",naghmeh@dei.uc.pt,2825_,1983-09-20,naghmeh,4

This form of interactions can be quite difficult to implement, because the client, server, or communication channel may fail, potentially requiring diverse and complex recovery procedures, which may result in duplicate messages being processed at the server. In this paper we address the fol- lowing question: could we provide a meaningful taxonomy of reliable request-response protocols? We generate valid sequences of client and server actions, organize the generated sequences into a prefix tree, and classify them according to their reliability semantics and memory requirements. The tree reveals three families of protocols matching common real-world implementations that try to deliver exactly-once or at-most-once. The strict organization of the protocols provides a solid foundation for creating correct services, and we show that it also serves to easily identify fallacies and pitfalls of existing implementations.","Reliable Distributed Communication","Reliability, Exactly-Once, At-Most-Once, Taxonomy",0000-00-00,2015,1,Y,"Naghmeh Ramezani Ivaki",naghmeh@dei.uc.pt,2825_,1983-09-20,naghmeh,4

4272,2825,"A Design Pattern for Reliable HTTP-Based Applications","HTTP is currently being used as the communication protocol for many applications on the web, supporting business and safety-critical services throughout the world. Despite the growing importance, HTTP-based applications are quite exposed to network failures, which can bring in huge losses to the service users and providers, including financial and reputation losses. Several approaches try to achieve reliable communication by using logging and retransmission of whole HTTP messages, which is especially ill-adapted to large messages. Stream-based approaches are more efficient as, upon failure, they transparently resume data transmission from where it stopped. Despite this, designing a stream-based mechanism involves significant challenges, as it is very difficult to know how much data is lost due to failure. In this paper we propose a stream-based mechanism for reliable HTTP communication that is entirely based on HTTP messages and is compatible with existing software. The mechanism is presented as a design pattern and relieves developers from explicitly handling connection failures, providing a standard way for building more reliable applications. Results show that the mechanism is functional, compatible with legacy applications, and that the coding and runtime costs of this design pattern are quite low.

Although there is general acknowledgement that failures in these systems often entail significant impact both on the proceeds and reputation of companies, the benchmarks developed and managed by the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) still maintain their focus on reporting bare performance. Each TPC benchmark has to pass a list of dependability-related tests (to verify ACID properties), but not all benchmarks require measuring their performances. While TPC-E measures the recovery time of some system failures, TPC-H and TPC-C only require functional correctness of such recovery. Consequently, systems used in TPC benchmarks are tuned mostly for performance. In this paper we argue that nowadays systems should be tuned for a more comprehensive suite of dependability tests, and that a dependability metric should be part of TPC benchmark publications. The paper discusses WHY and HOW this can be achieved. Two approaches are introduced and discussed: augmenting each TPC benchmark in a customized way, by extending each specification individually; and pursuing a more unified approach, defining a generic specification that could be adjoined to any TPC benchmark.",,"Industry standard benchmarks, ACID properties, Durability, Dependability.",0000-00-00,2010,1,U,"Raquel Rute Duarte Almeida",rrute@dei.uc.pt,2828_,1975-06-13,rrute,4

Our research focuses on planning a WSN to avoid excess traffic during sensing and acting to guarantee the minimal delay for critical scenarios, such as industrial applications and closed-loop control applications. In this paper we report on our experience with both a simple plan for adapting a WSN for high-rate sampling objectives and with experimental tests. Simple theoretical results let us know whether a network plan will be able to handle data processing as required. With this first-cut plan we can then test the performance of the network and if necessary reconfigure it. Basic data quality issues are also taken into account. Different characteristics can be chosen depending on application needs, resulting in reconfiguration of network parameters (number of nodes, network partitions or reduction of the sampling rate or application of filters to the data). We report on the experimental results in a testbed and industrial environment.","WSN, data Analysis","Industrial Applications, WSN, Network planning",0000-00-00,2011,1,Y,"José Cecílio",jcecilio@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2830_,1982-11-11,jcecilio,4

The underlying infrastructure may include wired or wireless devices, PCs and backbone servers arranged in an heterogeneous distributed system. Direct interfacing of sensor and actuator nodes to the industrial networks allow monitoring and control systems to be easily integrated and commanded from external, possibly web-based platforms. These architectures raise important research issues in terms of performance control requirements. 
In this paper we propose a framework for interacting with real-world devices by abstracting proprietary protocols, allowing the interaction between client applications and heterogeneous sensor network platforms and protocols. The architecture was designed to allow the (re)configuration of alarms, actions or closed-loop techniques in any part of the system &#40;sensors or PCs&#41;, offering flexibility and the possibility to modify for providing performance control guarantees. It allows users to configure and apply various operations, including complex closed-loop techniques that monitor and act over any actuator in the network, independently of the underlying node infrastructure. Supported by the proposed architecture we develop a framework that is being deployed in an industrial testbed.  The performance of the prototype implementation will be discussed with emphasis on timing because the readings are used to compute closed-loop control.

However, in industrial applications, WSNs still aren’t seen as a viable option because of the required fast sampling rates and the reduced time delay, particularly in a multi-hop deployment where traffic congestion may occur. Message losses are unacceptable, particularly in what concerns critical messages containing actuation instructions or other urgent data, which may have time-constraint requirements that cannot be guaranteed. Our research focuses on integrating traffic-aware data processing strategies and network traffic prioritization to overcome congestion states, in order to guarantee that urgent alarms and commands are enacted in time. Traffic is divided into urgent messages (alarms and actuation commands), that have time-delivery requirements; and the remaining periodic sensed data. In this paper we propose an integrated approach NetDP, which applies adaptable data processing strategies (DP) and traffic reduction (DP-Manager) policies to ensure that application requirements are satisfied with minimal message losses, while simultaneously guaranteeing timely delivery of alarms. We demonstrate that NETDP solution with different data processing strategies and levels of system stress can efficiently guarantee the timely delivery of alarms and actuation messages.","WSN, Planning","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Data Processing, Alarm delivery guarantees.",0000-00-00,2011,1,Y,"José Cecílio",jcecilio@dei.uc.pt,../_photos/2830_,1982-11-11,jcecilio,4

Many new goal and data-oriented algorithms have been proposed for the problem of routing data in sensor networks. Most routing protocols can be classified as data-centric, hierarchical, location-based or QoS-aware. Data-centric protocols are query-based and depend on the naming of desired data. Hierarchical protocols aim at clustering the nodes so that cluster heads can do some aggregation and reduction of data in order to save energy. Location-based protocols utilize the position information to relay the data to the desired regions. The QoS-aware are based on general network-flow modeling for meeting some QoS requirements. In this chapter, we will explore the goal and data-oriented routing mechanisms for sensor networks developed in recent years.

Nowadays, storage capacity increased significantly at affordable prices (below 50$/terabyte) with improved transfer rates, and faster random access times particularly with modern SSD disks.

In order to accomplish that, they are adopting new storage schemas, developing better compression algorithms, using faster hardware, optimizing parallel and distributed data processing. Current row-wise systems do not exploit massive ordering redundancy, and current column-wise approaches exploit only partially. An important current research issue concerns replacing optimization and processing complexity by less complex but ultra fast solutions. We propose the varDB approach to optimize performance over data warehouses. The solution minimizes complex operators, by applying a simple scheme and organizing all structures and processing to that end: massive ordering with efficient sorting and log2N searching. Considering data warehouses, with periodic loads and frequent analysis operations, such an approach provides very fast query processing. In our work we show how it is possible to use this massive data ordering/sorting in order to optimize queries for high speed, even without the use of data compression (therefore also avoiding compression/decompression overheads). We dedicate our attention to sort columns of data and correlating them with other replicated and unsorted columns. For querying, we focus on binary-search and the use of mainly offsets. Our tests of loading data, sorting vs. creating indexes and executing very selective operations like data filtering and joining show, using a simple disk based prototype, that we are able to obtain much better performance comparing with optimized row-wise engines, and also improvements when comparing with column-wise optimized engines. Comparing to those we were able to attain at least similar performance for many queries and much better performance for queries with complex joins.

One important key of many such WSAN applications is the needed to meet non-functional requirements (e.g., lifetime, reliability, time guarantees) as well as functional ones (e.g. monitoring, actuation). Some application domains even require that sensor nodes be deployed in harsh environments (e.g., refineries), where they can fail due to communication interference, power problems or other issues. Unfortunately, the node failures can be catastrophic for critical or safety related systems. State machines can offer a promising approach to separate the two concerns – functional and non-functional – bringing forth reliability exception conditions handling, by means of fault handling states. We develop an approach that allows users to define and program typical applications using their platform language, but also adds state machine logic to design, view and handle explicitly other concerns such as reliability.

proposing an adaptive Evolutionary Testing methodology for promoting the introduction of relevant instructions into the generated test cases by means of mutation; the instructions from which the algorithm can choose are ranked, with their rankings being updated every generation in accordance to the feedback obtained from the individuals evaluated in the preceding generation. The experimental studies developed show that the adaptive strategy proposed improves the algorithm's efficiency considerably, while introducing a negligible computational overhead.","Evolutionary Testing",,2009-07-01,2009,1,U,"Francisco Fernández de Vega",fcofdez@unex.es,NULL,NULL,,4

The goal of this work is to study the real level of interoperability provided by these technologies through a massive experimental campaign involving a wide set of very popular frameworks for web services, implemented using seven different programming languages. We have tested the inter-operation of eleven client-side framework subsystems with three of the most widely used server-side implementations, each one hosting thousands of different services. The results highlight numerous situations where the goal of interoperability between different frameworks is not met due to problems both on the client and the server side.

Although designed to support inter-operation, research and practice suggest that existing client-side and server-side frameworks, many times, cannot fully inter-operate. The problem is that, as web services are increasingly being deployed to support business-critical environments, interoperability issues may prevent or impact business transactions, potentially resulting in huge financial and reputation losses. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of the interoperability of 1024 publicly available web services, against a set of diverse and well-known client- side web service frameworks. We have detected at least one severe interoperability issue in over 54% of the services tested and quite different inter-operation capabilities regarding the client-side frameworks. Results clearly show that, although providers frequently claim interoperability capabilities, urgent improvements are required.","web services interoperability",,2014-06-27,2014,1,N,"Ivano Alessandro Elia",ivanoe@dei.uc.pt,1435239586_myPic43.jpg,1981-05-12,ivanoe,4

In typical business-critical services environments the occurrence of interoperability issues can have disastrous consequences, including direct financial costs, reputation, and client fidelity losses. Despite this, experience suggests that interoperability is still quite difficult to achieve, since the heterogeneity of frameworks for providing web services is quite large. In addition, current tools have limited testing capabilities and, in many cases do not specialize in this problem. In this paper we present ITWS, an extensible Interoperability Testing tool for Web Services that is able to assess the interoperability of a web service, supported by any given framework. We have used ITWS to test the interoperability of a set of home-implemented TPC-App web services and a set of thousands of web services created in .NET C# against 11 client-side web service frameworks, including frameworks for mainstream programming languages. Numerous issues have been disclosed, showing the benefits of using ITWS and the importance of testing services for interoperability.","web services interoperability",,2014-06-27,2014,1,N,"Ivano Alessandro Elia",ivanoe@dei.uc.pt,1435239586_myPic43.jpg,1981-05-12,ivanoe,4

An extensible tool, that implements the proposed approach, has been used to run a large campaign during which we have tested the interoperability of a large number of web services, comprising both home-implemented and publicly available services, de-ployed on top of several web service platforms and against 11 client-side web service platforms.

In this paper, we lay the foundations of an interoperability certification process for web services, which allows attesting the interoperability level of a given web service and also identifying possible interoperability issues. In practice, the process can be used by developers or providers to certify a given web service for interoperability, ensuring successful interaction with client-side platforms.

2717,10101,"Leveraging temporal expressions for segmented-based information retrieval","The extraction of temporal information from text documents is becoming increasingly important in many applications such as natural language processing, information retrieval, question answering, etc.. Indeed, the temporal dimension plays a key role on most of these systems, promoting better performance. Our goal is the definition of a temporal document representation, incorporating the time dimension into information retrieval model to improve the quality of the results. Our approach is based on temporal segmentation of documents. Temporal-aware retrieval models may explore a richer temporal document representation, enabled by segmentation. To achieve this, first we must identify temporal expressions and capture, when possible, their normalized time values. Starting from our prior work on temporal expressions recognition, we present in this paper, a resolution tool that achieves promising results in a Portuguese collection. Furthermore, a temporal characterization of the used collection shows enough and suitable information for a meaningful temporal document segmentation.","Temporal Information Extraction","Temporal Retrieval, Normalization, Temporal Expressions",0000-00-00,2010,1,Y,"Joaquim Macedo",macedo@di.uminho.pt,NULL,NULL,,4

No entanto, a utilização de informação temporal para melhorar os resultados das pesquisas tem sido pouco explorada, apesar de existir um grande potencial para conseguir
esse melhoramento. De facto, a noção de tempo é essencial para muitas das pesquisas efectuadas num sistema de recolha de informação, como por exemplo, na área da saúde onde será pertinente reconstruir o historial clínico dos pacientes com a capacidade de encontrar eventos e apresentá-los num espaço temporal, permitindo, desta forma, dar maior exactidão ao relatório (Alonso et al., 2007). 
No entanto, nem sempre o tempo surge de forma explícita nos documentos, mas as referências temporais podem ajudar a identificar a relevância dos documentos encontrados. O interesse no processamento de informação temporal tem crescido nos últimos anos e tem-se intensificado nas mais diversas áreas de investigação.
O objectivo do sistema que desenvolvemos é o de identificar informação temporal existente em documentos, para posteriormente ser utilizada, como papel importante na ordenação da lista de resultados obtida pelas pesquisas efectuadas em sistemas de recolha de informação.
Como existe ainda pouco trabalho desenvolvido no processamento de informação temporal da língua portuguesa, decidimos criar um sistema de raiz que seguisse um algoritmo simples e rápido. O processo de anotação/extracção de informação num sistema de recolha de informação terá de ser rápido para que não comprometa todo o sistema.
Pretende-se que o sistema PorTexTO, designado por PORtuguese Temporal EXpressions Tool, seja um sistema simples e com baixo tempo de processamento. Para que o desempenho não seja comprometido, o sistema poderá não encontrar todas as expressões temporais existentes nos documentos que processar, mas deverá encontrar as que ocorram mais vezes nos documentos em português e que são definidas através de estudo estatístico.","Temporal Expression Annotation","Temporal Information Extraction",2008-12-31,2008,5,Y,"Joaquim Macedo",macedo@di.uminho.pt,NULL,NULL,,4

The electronic transduction signal is transmitted by digital modulation from a remote transduction unit fixed to a rotation shaft to a base station sending signals to a personal computer (PC) by means of a virtual instrument developed in LABVIEW. The signal can also be delivered to other units besides the PC. The ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 protocol is the standard protocol for wireless communications and is highly used in industrial monitoring and control applications. A low-noise method for supplying the remote transduction unit components in the rotation shaft—using its rotating movement to generate the demanded energy—has also been developed. After extensive experimentation, the theoretical model seems to confirm the idea proposed. The system presented in this study is robust, precise, cost-effective, and has high-noise immunity even in abrasive and strong vibration environments.","Self-Powered Telemetric Torque Meter","ZigBee Protocol, Telemetric Torque Meter, Oil-pump Automation",2011-04-07,2011,3,U,"Eudisley Gomes dos Anjos",eudis@dei.uc.pt,1342536686_eudis.png,1984-03-01,eudis,4

This paper presents a comparison framework that identifies the most relevant features for categorizing different architecture evaluation tools according to six different dimensions. The results show the attributes that a comprehensive tool should support including: the ability to handle multiple modeling approaches, integration with the industry standard UML or specific ADL, support for trade-off analysis of competing quality attributes and, the reuse of knowledge through the build-up of new architectural patterns. This comparison is able to, not only guide the choice of evaluation, but also promote the development of more powerful tools for modeling and analysis of software architectures.","Classification of Software Architecture Tools","affidavit, architecture evaluation process, software architecture, software quality challenges, trends for achieving quality objectives.",2011-06-21,2011,1,Y,"Eudisley Gomes dos Anjos",eudis@dei.uc.pt,1342536686_eudis.png,1984-03-01,eudis,4

A mathematical model was developed. The electronic transduction signal is transmitted by digital modulation from a remote transduction unit fixed to a shaft to a base station, sending the signal to a PC, by means of a VI (Virtual Instrument) developed in LabView. It can also be delivered to other units besides the PC. The use of digital modulation to transmit the radiofrequency signal, replacing conventional couplings, allows communication with a high signal/noise ratio. A clamp acts as sealant, protecting it from the environment and making it easier to install. The prototype can be used at situation that it is impossible to use flanges or sockets (the most of the industrial applications) and it is installed directly on the surface of the shaft. The use of superbatteries allows the remote unit to remain independent of a feed for several days, with long periods between maintenance. After thousands of experimental essays, the theoretical model seems to confirm the proposed idea. The system presented has a potential for high precision, low cost, long work life and easy maintenance.","Study of a Telemetric Dynamic Torque Meter","dynamic torque meter, telemetry, strain gage, electronic transduction and transduction by LabView",2010-07-01,2010,3,U,"Eudisley Gomes dos Anjos",eudis@dei.uc.pt,1342536686_eudis.png,1984-03-01,eudis,4

Unexpectedly, sequential Exception Handling models remain as the most used tool for robustness, even in the most recent concurrent programming languages. Though, the appearance of more complex models, such as programming languages with implicit concurrency, might pose a challenge too big for these sequential mechanisms.

Since memory and processor architectures of CPUs and GPUs are substantially different, programs designed for each platform are also very different and often resort to a very distinct set of algorithms and data structures. But, using the right “gear” is not always a guarantee that programs will execute faster on their targeted platform. Variations in the hardware of the GPU and in the size of data, among others, can have a major influence in performance. 
ÆminiumGPU is a new high-level programming framework for developing and running parallel programs in CPUs and GPUs. ÆminiumGPU programs are written in a high-level general purpose programming language and compiled into hybrid executables which can run in both platforms. Thus, the decision of which platform is going to be used for executing a program is delayed until run-time and automatically performed by the system using Machine-Learning techniques.
Our tests show that ÆminiumGPU is able to achieve speedups up to 65x and that the average accuracy of the platform selection algorithm, in choosing the best platform for executing a program, is above 92\%.","GPU programming framework: applying machine learning techniques to improve performance",,2013-01-01,2013,1,Y,"Alcides Fonseca",amaf@dei.uc.pt,1419357974_26ad7ba.jpg,1988-11-24,amaf,4

In this paper we present the ÆMINIUM concurrent-by-default programming language. Using ÆMINIUM programmers express data dependencies rather than control flow between instructions. Dependencies are expressed using permissions, which are used by the type system to automatically parallelize the application. The ÆMINIUM approach provides a modular and composable mechanism for writing concurrent applications, preventing data races in a provable way. This allows programmers to shift their attention from low-level, error-prone reasoning about thread interleaving and synchronization to focus on the core functionality of their applications. We study the semantics of ÆMINIUM through ?ÆMINIUM, a sound core calculus that leverages permission flow to enable concurrent-by-default execution. After discussing our prototype implementation we present several case studies of our system. Our case studies show up to 6.5X speedup on an eight-core machine when leveraging data group permissions to manage access to shared state, and more than 70% higher throughput in a web server application.","ÆMINIUM: A Permission Based Concurrent-by-Default Programming Language Approach","access permissions, permissions, data groups, concurrency",2014-03-01,2014,3,Y,"Alcides Fonseca",amaf@dei.uc.pt,1419357974_26ad7ba.jpg,1988-11-24,amaf,4

In this paper we propose an exception-handling model for concurrent systems. Its main quality attributes are simplicity and expressiveness, allowing programmers to deal with exceptional situations in a concurrent setting in a familiar way. The proposal is centered on a new kind of exception type that defines new paths for exception propagation among concurrent threads of execution.

In these countries, mobility of people is mainly ensured by bus services and a large- scale informal public transport service, known as paratransit (e.g., car rapides in Senegal, Tro Tros in Ghana, taxis in Uganda and Ethiopia, and Matatus in Keneya, etc.). Transport demand estimation is a challenging task, particularly in developing countries, mainly due to its expensive and time consuming data collection requirements. Without accurate demand estimation, it is difficult for transport operators to provide their services and make other important decisions. In this article, we present a methodology to estimate passenger demand for public transport services using cell phone data. Significant origins and destinations of inhabitants are extracted and used to build origin-destination matrices that resemble travel demand. Based on the inferred travel demand, we are able to reasonably suggest strategic locations for public transport services such as paratransit and taxi stands, and new transit routes.

The most powerful FPGAs are based in SRAM technology which is particularly prone to transient faults. Fault-tolerance is therefore mandatory and this can be done by simply reprogramming the FPGA, thus repairing the corrupted configuration. Recent advances in FPGA technology allow the configuration of just a portion of the FPGA, which lowers significantly the time overhead, while the remaining parts are running. This truly dynamic partial FPGA reconfiguration can be used to provide fault-tolerance for hard real-time applications, guaranteeing high reliability in long missions. This short paper addresses the technological aspects of partial dynamic reconfigurable FPGAs, presents some of most important threats to dependability of these devices, and identifies some research areas to investigate in order to increase dependability.","FPGA reconfiguration","FPGA, reconfiguration, dependability",2011-05-11,2011,1,Y,"José Luis Guerra da Rocha Nunes",jnunes@dei.uc.pt,,1974-04-10,jnunes,4

The results of our work provide important performance guidelines for grid developers and administrators.

3722,10360,"A Fault-Tolerant Session Layer with Reliable One-Way Messaging and Server Migration Facility","Despite being extremely successful, TCP has a number of shortcomings when network disruptions occur, or when peers do not follow a request-reply interaction: it does not handle connection crashes, event-driven communication or application migration. In many cases, programmers must engineer their own solutions to write reliable distributed applications.
To overcome these limitations, we propose FTSL, a Fault- Tolerant Session Layer that works on top of TCP. Besides offering a full-duplex connection, FTSL owns a number of distinctive features: it tolerates TCP connection crashes, it provides highly decoupled reliable patterns for one-way communication, and it enables server-side migration. While the first two greatly simplify distributed systems programming for a wide range of applications, the latter enables cloud systems managers to move a server application for load balance or maintenance, without moving the entire virtual machine. We present the FTSL protocol, its implementation, and resort to performance to show that FTSL imposes a reasonable overhead for the guarantees it provides.","Reliable Distributed Communication","Fault Tolerance, Application Migration, One- Way Messaging, TCP, Session Layer",0000-00-00,2014,1,Y,"Serhiy Boychenko",serhiy@student.dei.uc.pt,NULL,NULL,serhiy,4
4079,10360,"Replica Placement to Mitigate Attacks on Clouds","Execution of critical services traditionally requires multiple distinct replicas, supported by independent networks and hardware. To operate properly, these services often depend on the correctness of a fraction of replicas, usually over $2/3$ or $1/2$. Defying the ideal situation, economical reasons may tempt users to replicate critical services onto a single multi-tenant cloud infrastructure. Since this may expose users to correlated failures, we assess the risks for two kinds of majorities: a conventional one, related to the number of replicas, regardless of the machines where they run; and a second one, related to the physical machines where the replicas run. This latter case may exist in multi-tenant virtualized environments only.

 To assess these risks, under crash and Byzantine failures of virtual and physical machines, we resort to theoretical and experimental evaluation. Contrary to what one might expect, we conclude that it is not always favorable to distribute replicas evenly over a fixed number of physical machines. On the contrary, we found cases where they should be as unbalanced as possible. We systematically identify the best defense for each kind of failure and majority to preserve. We then review the most common real-life attacks on clouds and discuss the \emph{a priori} placement of service replicas that minimizes the effects of these attacks.

4441,10360,"On Client-Side Bottleneck Identification in HTTP Servers","Standing on virtualization techniques, low maintenance costs and economies of scale, cloud computing emerged in the last few years as a major trend in the industry. Since cloud resources grow and shrink as needed, providers and users of the cloud must carefully determine the exact amount of such resources they need. For this reason, getting accurate and timely information from the system is of paramount importance to properly adjust the means serving a given application. However, previous attempts to detect bottlenecks have resulted in complex, heavy and customized frameworks that lack any sort of standardization and may change widely from provider to provider. Improved monitoring mechanisms should be independent from the server technology, should require little to no configuration and should provide information of the real quality of service offered to clients.

To reach these goals, we intend to observe the server infrastructure from the outside and gather the smallest possible number of metrics from the inside. We undertook several experiments in a controlled server, to identify the patterns that correspond to bottlenecks. These experiments clearly show that one can actually diagnose different bottlenecks, by analyzing response times on browsers. These results pave the way to future monitoring mechanisms, mostly based on quality of service evidence, supported by user data.

4442,10360,"Online Client-Side Bottleneck Identification on HTTP Server Infrastructures","Ensuring short response times is a major concern for all web site administrators. To keep these times under control, they usually resort to monitoring tools that collect a large spectrum of system metrics, such as CPU and memory occupation, network traffic, number of processes, etc. Despite providing a reasonably accurate picture of the server, the times that really matter are those experienced by the user. However, not surprisingly, system administrators will usually not have access to these end-to-end figures, due to their lack of control over web browsers.
To overcome this problem, we follow the opposite approach of monitoring a site based on times collected from browsers. We use two browser-side metrics for this: $i$) the time it takes for the first byte of the response to reach the user (request time) and $ii$) the time it takes for the entire response to arrive (response time). We conjecture that an appropriate choice of the resources to control, more precisely, one or two URLs, suffices to detect CPU, network and I/O bottlenecks. In support of this conjecture, we run periodical evaluations of request and response times on some very popular web sites to detect bottlenecks.
Our experiments suggest that collecting data from the browsers can indeed contribute for better monitoring tools that provide a deeper understanding of the system, thus helping to maintain faster, more interactive web sites.","Distributed Systems",,2015-06-21,2015,1,Y,"Serhiy Boychenko",serhiy@student.dei.uc.pt,NULL,NULL,serhiy,4

4111,10690,"On the Evaluation of Software Maintainability Using Automatic Test Case Generation","The measurement of external software attributes and the analysis of how those attributes have evolved through the software's releases are challenging activities. This is particularly evident when we discuss the maintainability of Object-Oriented (OO) systems which, due to their specific characteristics, hide information that cannot be gathered through static analysis. As maintainability can be defined as the ""speed and ease with which a program can be corrected or changed"", we believe that test data are reflective of the changes performed during maintenance. Moreover, empirical observations allow to speculate about the relationships between maintainability and the behaviour of the software when executed by test cases (e.g., coverage values) and the test cases' characteristics (e.g., generation time). Our aim is to complement the state-of-the art by proposing a new approach for understanding and characterizing the maintainability of OO systems, which makes use of test data and of the information gathered from the tests' execution.","Software Engineering","Complexity theory,Correlation,Measurement,Ontologies,Software;Standards,Testing,Software Maintenance,Software Quality,Software Testing",2014-09-26,2014,1,Y,"Ana Filipa Nogueira",afnog@dei.uc.pt,NULL,NULL,afnog,4

This growth led to the exploration of new services that could enhance users’ experiences and constitute a driver for even more followers. With the proliferation of smartphones and the increasing search for applications that enable the sharing of experiences, social networks became eager to integrate into mobile devices, taking advantage of their impressive omnipresence and panoply of sensors. Amongst the sensors, the most notable are the localization sensors (GPS) that allow for the development of location-based services that use the geographical position to enrich user experiences in a variety of contexts, including location-based searching and location-based mobile interaction. ChronoFindMe enhances location-based services by adding a temporal component not present in current approaches. The authors allow information about past and future locations to be considered by defining an architecture that provides location-based services to users of social networks. This information includes data about time and space, which can be accessed through the social network or a specific mobile application, using privacy policies to assure users’ privacy.","Social Networks; Mobile location services","Social Networks; Mobile location services",2013-06-01,2013,5,N,"Ana Filipa Nogueira",afnog@dei.uc.pt,NULL,NULL,afnog,4
